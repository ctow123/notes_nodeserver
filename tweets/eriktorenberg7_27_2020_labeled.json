You now needed:\n\n- More agile product strategy\n- Different GTM strategy (old model was expensive sales channel partners. In new model, deals are smaller &amp; higher velocity)\n- Marketing &amp; product can't be silo'edWhat metrics should CS managers prioritize?\n\nLagging indicators - Gross Retention Rate &amp; Net Renewal Rate (includes upsell) &amp; NPS\n\nLeading indicators - Depends on product but could be overall adoption, daily active usage, NPS, e-mail engagement,Much of this was inspired by @nrmehta, CEO of @GainsightHQ and author of \"Customer Success\"\n\nhttps://t.co/0eKXgcOT0j\n\nI went deeper w/ him here: https://t.co/BQ0vM9BFxz",

However, unless you\u2019re the NYT, trying to do everything is a recipe for failing at everything\n\nThese strategies require diff approachesOn one side you will have the aggregators as ideal vehicles for content creators who value reach; on the other new kinds of tools that enable direct connection\u2014&amp; funding\u2014from fans.

They also might have a screw loose in at least 1-2 dimensions.\n\nThe ones that thrive are self-aware enough to know where their screws are loose, &amp; seek a compliment to solve for it.If you\u2019re going to succeed as a startup, you need to be able to find and hire undiscovered talent. \n\nYou cannot recruit people who are proven.\n\nWhy? There will always be large incumbents outbidding you when trying to hire known talented individuals\n\nhttps://t.co/yuyx5Sogd3Quoting Vinod Khosla: \u201cThe team you build is the company you build\u201d\n\nQuoting Patrick Collison: \u201cThe reason why the first 10 employees are the most important is every one of those 10 employees is going to replicate him or herself 10 times.Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for.When attempting to hire unrecognized potential, you'll inherently make mistakes (if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re too conservative)\n\nDon\u2019t try to be a \u201czero-defect hirer.\u201d\n\nThe false-negative hires (the ppl you didn\u2019t hire that could have been great) are more of a mistake than the bad hiresWhen you need upside, hire aptitude. When protecting against the downside, hire experience.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to create something from scratch, experience is often a handicap\u201dDouble down on your stars:\n\nIf you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is way more important than trying to fix ppl who will never create 10x value. \n\nManagement drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employees.What to do w/ struggling employees?\n\nMost managers in baseball usually make the mistake of leaving in their starting pitcher too long, as opposed to calling for the relief pitcher\n\nThe starter got you so far, but you need a different skill set to go forward.How to identify stars? \n\nNotice who people in the company go to talk to that they don\u2019t have to (watch whose desk becomes popular \u2013 this is especially noticeable in an open office).\n\nThat's how you discover the problem solvers\u201cConstantly expand the scope of responsibility for every single employee. Everybody will break at some point, but you want to keep pushing the envelope until they can\u2019t discharge that level of responsibly successfully anymore.\u201dBenefits of small teams:\n\n- People have an ownership mentality\n- You can see who\u2019s doing well\n- It\u2019s easier to spot the existing skill gaps\n- People have a sense of independence\n- A narrower focus/scope results, this improving executionUp until 20-50 employees, manage \"through osmosis.\"\n\nAfter that, weekly-wide company meeting, weekly 1on1s w/ 5-7 direct reports (direct report set agenda)\n\nEveryone should understand the company\u2019s priorities, business equation, biggest risks and plans to solve for them.In a startup, domain expertise isn\u2019t all that important\n\nExperts tend to know what you can\u2019t do very well. They don\u2019t ask enough why questions; \u2018Why can\u2019t this be done this way? I like people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re tackling, but they\u2019re fast learners.For investments: \n\n\"I tend to like things that are super ambitious, that are almost ridiculous. Just how ridiculous? \n\nI want half of my VC friends to laugh at an investment I make. If half don\u2019t laugh, it means I\u2019m not taking enough risk, and the project isn\u2019t ambitious enough.\"Criteria for founders: Magnet for Talent.\n\nHow to test?\n\nCall former colleagues of the founder, and ask them if they would join (or invest in) the founder\u2019s current company, and why/why notOn Total Available Market (TAM) Analyses:\n\nThe real issue with a small TAM is not that the market isn't big enough, it's that the value prop isn't compelling enough. If you make it more compelling, you'll capture more value.Startups have roughly the same amount of pain to go from 0 to 1, regardless of whether 1 is a $100 billion company or $100 million company, so you might as well do something important because the pain\u2019s going to be the same. You might as well get the outcome that offsets the painHow to be strategic? Understand the business equation.\n\n\"Every business, when it works, is like an equation \u2013 X times Y times Z with some weighting. Understanding that equation in your brain, and being able to manipulate the variables, is the key to being strategic.\u201dPeople w/ good strategy know what knobs they have at their disposal, which they can turn and how they affect each other. If you know one knob can only be turned up to 7, they don\u2019t try to turn it to 8, they say \u201cmaybe we can turn this other knob up and it\u2019s more likely to work\u201d.Margins don\u2019t matter as much as you think, but cash flow does:\n\nImagine you have a business that kicks off at 10% margins, but it grows to be 10% of everything on the planet \u2013 that\u2019s a big business\u201cIf your tech is better, but potential customers are too set in their ways to switch, use it yourself and compete with them\u201d \n\n\"If you\u2019re a company who\u2019s better at reducing fraud, you don\u2019t want to sell that as service to somebody else, you want to build the full stack yourselfBeing a component in someone else\u2019s stack doesn\u2019t usually end well\n\nThere\u2019s the adoption risk issue (long sales cycles etc.)\n\nThere\u2019s economic issues \u2013 you\u2019re only capturing 10-30% of the value you create, if you\u2019re selling to someone else, depending on how good you are at sales)As an example, if you have a differentiated advantage (say in chip design or battery life) you want to ship the end product to the customer yourself (and not sell your batteries to someone like Apple) \u2013 this way you get more credit for what you\u2019re asymmetrically good at.Lesson learned from Pat Riley's Winner Within:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the best at what you do, you want to be the only one who does what you do\u201d\n\nYou often have to narrow the scope of what you do to accomplish that.Keith\u2019s Superpowers:\n\n1/ Being able to spot 19-28-year-old people with talent, who have yet to be discovered or experience success, and project their future potential (and then go on to mentor or invest in them)\n\n2/ Blending design thinking w/ empirical analysis.On deciding btwn founding v. join:\n\nFind path w/ steepest slope. Something that makes you nervous/uncomfortable. If not, you\u2019re not maximizing growth\n\nSome learn best thrown into the deep end, try to swim (founding). Others learn best by watching first (joining)\n\nKnow your style.Once someone gets older, there\u2019s enough data points on their resume where many people could evaluate their background and come to the same conclusion; their potential and abilities are well-defined.What you want to do is find someone that doesn\u2019t have enough data points, and instead you have to try to project potential and how they may translate to a certain profession without knowing with certainty.For example, a CS student from Stanford is incredibly overrated in terms of demand for their talent versus what they can actually do on average. You have plenty of people throwing money at them. They don\u2019t always develop the best work ethic because of that. They're entitled.What you want to find are people that other people aren\u2019t chasing after but they have even more talent &amp; grit. That\u2019s doable, but hard. It\u2019s a little bit like drafting athletes in various sports. You're trying to find Tom Brady in the 6th round.What to look for in a co-founder? \n\n#1 Someone who can help you solve core risks to the biz. Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles (data vs design driven culture, closed vs open ecosystem, similar instincts on ppl).Is VC more like baseball or basketball:\n\nBasketball: Team cohesion crucial, 1 Lebron can dominate, but can't have 3 bc not enough ball to go around\n\nBaseball: Mostly collection of individuals &amp; clear accountability, can have many heavy hitters, 1 Lebron isn't as dominantDecision making framework:\n\nDon\u2019t make a list of pros and cons; that\u2019s not a great way to make these kind of decisions.\n\nFigure out your number one priority, and optimize on that dimension.Ben Franklin had this great quote which I\u2019ve always used as a guide for my own decision-making and career. It\u2019s, \u201cTwo ways to be successful in life: do something worth writing about or write something worth reading.\u201dFavorite interview question:\n\nWhat do you want to do with your life? That\u2019s usually my first question. Sometimes it catches people off-guard, but it allows you to quickly understand who they are, what they care about, and calibrate your feedback.If you\u2019re going to attract people with extremely high potential, the first thing you have to do is let them thrive. \n\nYou have to give them the degrees of freedom to do both what they can do very well, and to some extent, allow them to make mistakes.If you try to constrain really talented people, you\u2019re only going to create a mirror of yourself with your same strengths and weaknesses. \n\nYou HAVE to let people do stuff that you disagree with. You can\u2019t tell how good they are if they\u2019re just replicating what you\u2019d have them doManage People on Inputs, Not Outputs\n\nOtherwise nobody on your team will take on the more difficult tasks.\n\nSo, to incentivize employees to complete ambitious tasks, gauge the quality of their work based on how it effective it was at getting you towards an ambitious goal.On why anti-lean startup:\n\nThe best metaphor for creating a startup is like producing a movie\n\nSomeone has a vision for a movie, writes a script, casts it, finances the production, markets the film with a trailer, and then distributes it (and hopefully people come to see it)Thiel used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. \n\nAnd we all rebelled, b/c it's so unnatural, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing.Calendar audit: when I work with CEOs, I ask them to specify their priorities they are, pie-chart style, and then pull out their calendar and see if it matches.\n\nIt never does. Recruiting is the big thing that doesn't align.\u201cThe whole fake news debate is ridiculous. The average American today is by any metric, more informed than the average American any time in history.\u201d\n\nTyler Cowen has said \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say about Facebook that isn\u2019t true of the printing press\u201dDefinition of Professional Success:\n\nThe number of undiscovered talented ppl he\u2019s able to mentor that turn out to make meaningful impact in the world.\n\nThe number of companies he\u2019s able to help or influence, in one way or another, that end up going on to transform the world.",

Went so far with communism they ended up on the nationalist right.In 2011, tech stopped becoming beloved to the left (&amp; started threatening their existence) for the following reasons.\n\n- Economically attacking traditional American left power centers (NYT, Hollywood, Academia)\n\n- Undercutting prestige &amp; influence (e.g. fake news)- Pulling away top talent to tech companies\n\n- Becoming a more powerful global culture exporter\n\n- Building a network of super-wealthy people w/ an alternative network and path to power (Instead of become president, become CEO).\n\n- The outcome of 2016 election.One thing they implicitly mean by \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d is that tech is disruptive to how they work:\n\nHarvard does a study, NYT reports it, US gov\u2019t enacts it\n\nWhat do they want?

The question is, Is it the right time for my idea to happen?\"A startup isn\u2019t a company until it hacks its way through 3 distinct miracles:\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n1) The insight hack (insight development)\n\n2) The value hack (customer development)\n\n3) Growth hacking (going from 0-1 to 1-X)Value hacking:\n\nFigure out what you can uniquely do that ppl are desperate for\n\nIdentify a focus group of customers that desperately need your solution\n\nIterate &amp; improve your value proposition relentlessly until you start to see signs of exponential organic growthIf your value prop as a startup isn\u2019t true enough, &amp; your customer isn\u2019t desperate enough, you won\u2019t grow exponentially. You\u2019ll instead have to spend $ to overcome the objections to the gaps in your value prop.\n\nOnly think about growth after you\u2019ve proven your value hypothesis.On ideas:\n\nMost people are looking around their present world and searching for \"white space\" -- \"startup opportunity\". \n\nInstead, live in the future, find what's missing, and then show people the way forward.It might be time to start your startup when:\n\nYou have insider knowledge about a major change event.\n\nYou know the market opportunity and customer needs in a visceral way.\n\nYou have a vision of a problem to be solved based on your knowledge of the first two pointsHow do you know when it\u2019s time to double down on an idea?\n\nWhen no one can talk you out of doing it\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone reasonable who can talk you out of it, you\u2019re probably not ready for it\n\nOr when the pain of regret from not trying &gt; any possible pain experienced from failing\"Sometimes the world puts an opportunity in front of you that you\u2019re in a unique position to capitalize on before others, that leverages a unique domain skill you have, and takes advantage of something you\u2019ve seen before others because of your vantage point. It\u2019s tempting to say:\"You\u2019ll tackle it when you\u2019re ready\u2014when you have your things in place, when you have your ducks in a row, when the economy is more stable \u2026 But the reality is, if you plan to start something great, these kinds of opportunities are extremely rare\u2014maybe even once in a lifetime.\"The startup law of the jungle:\n\nStartups are initially very vulnerable to predators (like a newborn animal on the plains)\u00a0\n\nBeing non-consensus and right affords the startup the time to survive, adapt, and &amp; \u2013 no one preys on them because no one believes their idea\u2019s importantWith your product, have a good answer to the question:\u00a0\u201cWhat job do our customers hire this product to do?\u201d\n\nWhen you buy a new product, you hire it to help you do a job\n\nIf the product does the job well, you\u2019ll tend to hire it again\n\nIf it does a bad job, you\u2019ll fire itWhen you\u2019re starting a startup, you\u2019re going to war together. You gotta know you want to be in the fox hole with this person. You GOTTA know it. Because it\u2019s impossible enough as it is.

I think that on some level, the true measure of the disruptive power of an idea is the degree to which it can make change without throwing money at it.Fundamentally, a startup is all about harnessing exponential change to create a unique value proposition ppl are desperate for, that changes their point of view, &amp; grows at hyper-warp speed, all done by ppl who live in the future.

If you have 3 hrs of overlap, schedule meetings then.\n\nThere's no single right model.Hiring remotely:\n\nChallenge is it's hard to evaluate international CVs\u2014you don't know the university or company brands, &amp; there are also cultural differences that make evaluating talent hard\n\nThe solution is to focus on real work\n\nPick a challenge you understand &amp; have them do itCompensation:\n\nSome people think should pay equally everywhere.

There's always an incubation period.Blockchain is a new kind of meta computer that has this property of being able to make certain trust guarantees to users and to developers and to other people that you can't make w/ a traditional computer.\n\nCode becomes law, and you go from \"Don't Be Evil\" to \"Can't Be Evil\"Ideas need to be contrarian, otherwise big companies will just do them, or other competitors will emerge.\n\nSo we need to find good ideas that look like bad ideas but aren't actually bad ideas, even though most seemingly bad ideas are, in fact, bad ideas.How ppl respond to new tech\n\nI never heard of it\nI heard of it, but don\u2019t get it\nI get it, &amp; see how rich ppl would like it, but it's not useful for me\nI use it, but it\u2019s just a toy\nI use it all the time\nI can't imagine life without it\nIt\u2019s too powerful and needs to be regulated2 Critiques of Silicon Valley:\n\n1/ Not working on big enough problems. It's all silly apps. Should be more ambitious &amp; actually change the world. \n\n2/ SV is having too big an impact on culture &amp; society.

It becomes infinite, but only after infinite time\n\nWith hyperbolic growth, it can't keep growing forever, it becomes infinite at a definite time.As population growth became hyperbolic, we started to predict the timing of the singularity.\n\nBut every time we got close to it, popularity growth started to slow down. Makes sense.\n\nPopulation growth can't literally be infinite.

If they're in the role for 12 months, how do you know that they've been successful?Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for.Treat recruiting like a funnel.\n\nDiagram the entire experience &amp; identify potential leakage.\n\nIf you interview lots of ppl but don't make offers, that's either a poor evaluation process and/or sourcing problem\n\nIf you make offers but don't convert, something's wrong w/ your closeSourcing: \n\n- If you don't have a good enough top of funnel, then you end up compromising at the bottom of the funnel\n\n- Sell managers on the benefits of knowing how to do their own sourcing. (\"If you want to be a leader, you'll have to recruit)\n\n- Throw referral sourcing partiesSourcing:\n\n- Hire in-house recruiter early. Ask sourcers to have 100 targets per wk.\n\n- Like GTM, experiment w/ diff channels &amp; double down\n\n- Spend time w/ ideal passive candidates, recruiting over long time horizon\n\n- Qualify leads (\"Comp expectations? Ideal role &amp; location\"?)Building a interview process:\n\nTreat it like a scientific experiment\u2014You have a control group and you keep the criteria the same.\n\nMake sure that these candidates are asked the same questions in the same order. And you're evaluating them on the same thing so you can compare them.Have a \"scorecard\" that has the attributes you're looking for in the candidate per position, how much they matter, &amp; split up interviews accordingly.\n\nWhatever your hiring process is, codify it, and make sure everyone has access to it.\n\nBefore interviews, have Q's ahead of time.Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Decide too quickly whether they should hire this person or not. That's why it's important to have a checklist\n\n- Pick five qualities that you want to hire for and design questions for every quality. Have interviewers rate 1-5 &amp; compare. Calibrate ratersSample interview Q's:\n\n- If you were me, what kind of candidate would you be looking for?\n- If you joined &amp; then left in 3 months, why would that be?\n- What was your last boss like? How would they describe you?\n\nMore: https://t.co/xb3ov86rI1\n\nNot these ;) https://t.co/TlnuElQQ7kTop grade interview:\n\nPast performance is indicative of future performance, so dig in.\n\nGo through last 5 jobs &amp; ask:\n\n\"What were your accomplishments? Struggles? Who did you work closely w/ &amp; how would they rate the candidate from 1-10, in your opinion?\"\n\nThen reference.Reference philosophy:\n\n- On &amp; off-book references.\n\n- Decrease defensiveness to get better answers. Start by saying \"We really like X and we'd be excited to work w/ them. Curious to ask Q's to best set them up for success.\"\n\n- Do video to see body language.Q's to ask references:\n\n- How do they react to frustration?\n\n- What would that person's critic say? or last performance review?\n\n- Describe the ideal role?\n\n- Is this top 5% ppl you've worked w/? or Rate 1-10 but no 7.\n\n- If this didn't work out, why not?\n\nhttps://t.co/VvDjCR2hp9When referencing:\n\n- Sell the reference giver on why it's such an amazing opportunity!\n\n- Ask them for referrals for other great ppl that should join\n\n- Consider recruiting them if they are a fit &amp; seem interested!\n\n- Close the loop when you make them an offer. Make them an ally.Mistakes founders make: not optimizing candidate experience.\n\nWhen you interview the candidate, the candidate is selling you. But you should also be selling them\n\nNot only does that help you close the ppl you want to hire, but actually creates like word of mouth effect for othersHow to give a great candidate experience\n\n- Clear expectations of role across team\n- Consistent communication\n- Transparent &amp; sensible process\n- Social time w/ the team\n- Respect their time, particularly w/ take home work\n- Make them feel special, not a cog\n- Quality interviewsClosing candidates:\n\nIf you're unable to close candidates, then all else is meaningless.\n\nIt's also demoralizing to existing employees who interview the candidates (\"If they don't want to work here, why am I?\"\n\nSell the mission, the team, &amp; the opportunity. Make it compelling.Closing:\n\n- Aim for ~70% close rate.\n\n- Only make an offer when you're sure they'll accept. (\"If we give you X,Y, Z, would you accept?\")\n\n- Identify who influences their decision and take them out to dinner w/ candidate (spouse? peer?)\n\n- Enlist reference as an ally in closing.Closing:\n\nHave the investor sell the candidate on why they invested, why it'll be an enormous outcome, &amp; how they think about the team from an \"unbiased\" POV, and how the investor likes to invest in their employees future career success (perhaps even back their eventual startup)!Closing:\n\n- Q4 is best time to recruit. Holidays are reflective, post Q4 bonus, ppl are most ready to jump\n\n- Weather also helps. NYC kid comes in winter to SF &amp; sees sunshine...\n\n- 4 yr vest is natural, but don't be shy 1 mo after ppl join new co, in case it wasn't the right fitMistakes founders make:\n\n- Not allocating enough time to recruiting, esp. passive candidates.\n\n- CEOs think they have to build, but after they raise money their job is to hire people who can build.\n\n- Over 50% of founder's time should be spent hiring.

    "full_text": "Here are favorite takeaways &amp; quotes from Sam Altman interviews\n\nIt takes 10yrs to create a great startup. If you don\u2019t love &amp; believe it, you\u2019ll likely give up at some point along the way. There\u2019s no way I know of to get through the pain without a belief that the mission mattersOn Risk:\n\nMost people in the world will try to pull you back &amp; say, \u2018That seems a little too crazy'\n\nAt the end of the day, most ppl serve to pull you back towards the mean\n\nMost ppl tend to either be wrong abt what is/isn\u2019t risky or aren\u2019t taking enough risks (especially early)Most ppl are too risk-averse, and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths\n\nRisk: Also, let\u2019s re-define risk:\n\nI think what risk actually looks like is not doing something that you will then spend the rest of your life regrettingIt\u2019s easy to spend a decade being busy &amp; stressed every day, &amp; feeling like you\u2019re working hard and creating a ton of movement, but not moving forward.\n\nToo many ppl get caught up in the idea of \u201cworking hard\u201d w/o taking a pause to make sure they\u2019re moving in the right direction.Productivity:\n\nThis whole productivity porn thing where you have systems and multi-variable charts and 3-dimensional whatever, those people never seem to be the people that move the world forward\n\nMinimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don\u2019t really matter.The best ideas sound terrible at first\n\nBut this a good thing (it means there\u2019s less competition)\n\nAlso, the truly good ideas don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re worth stealing (so don\u2019t be afraid to share your idea with others)The best ideas are usually either very different from existing companies in one meaningful way or totally new\n\nIf it takes more than a sentence to explain what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s almost always a sign that it\u2019s too complicatedPeople use employee count as a metric for startup success\u2014this is wrong\n\nYou should instead be proud of how few employees you have.\u00a0Lots of employees equals a high burn rate\u2014meaning you\u2019re losing lots of money every month, complexity, tension, and slow decision-makingMediocre people at a big company cause some problems\u2014they don\u2019t usually kill the company.\u00a0\n\nA single mediocre hire out of your first five will often, in fact, kill a startup\n\nWith every early hire, ask: \u201cAm I willing to bet the future of the company on this one hire?Qualities in team:\n\nOptimists: The whole world will be telling you why you\u2019re going to fail as a startup. You need that internal fire of belief\n\nIdea Generators: Can generate solutions to solve problems\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve Got It\u201d: Ppl on your team who are always willing to step up to the job\"People that run companies are either a good leader or a good manager. I think I\u2019m a good leader and a bad manager.\"\n\nI think the best thing you can do is realize that, as a first-time founder, you\u2019re likely to be a terrible manager, &amp; then try to overcompensate for thatBeing super generous with early employee equity, and getting founder-quality people as the first 10 employees, I think all the evidence is on the side of doing this, and yet, almost no one does. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge edge if you\u2019re willing to do it.5 Jobs of a Startup CEO:\n\n- Set the vision\n- Raise money\n- Evangelize\n- Hire &amp; manage\n- Make sure the entire company executes\n\nAs a founder, you\u2019ll have 100s of important things competing for your attention\u2014your job is to identify the most critical, work on them, &amp; defer the restOn Evangelism:\n\nSomeone at the startup must be able to recruit, sell the product, talk to the press, raise money, etc.\n\nThis requires someone who can affect the whole world with enthusiasm about what the company\u2019s trying to doYou want a company to be winning all the time. If you ever take the foot off the gas pedal, things will spiral out of control and snowball downwards. A winning team feels good and keeps winning; a team that hasn\u2019t won in a while gets demotivated and keeps losing. \n\nKeep momentum!How to keep momentum:\n\nEstablish an operating rhythm\u2014ship product and launch new features weekly\n\nIgnore competitors (until they\u2019re beating you with a shipped product)\n\nCompetitors making noise is often what crushes a company\u2019s momentum more than any external factorThe number 1 lesson startups need is that the degree to which you\u2019re successful approximates the degree to which you build a product that\u2019s so good, ppl spontaneously tell their friends abt it\n\nPpl are more likely to tell their friends abt a product when it\u2019s easy to explainReal Trends vs. Fake Trends\n\nWith real trends, a new piece of tech comes along, &amp; the early adopters use it obsessively (and tell their friends how much they love it) (e.g iPhone)\n\nA fake trend is one where people may buy the product, but don\u2019t use it all that often (e.g. oculus)\"I learn pretty well by reading, but I learn much better by talking to the experts\"\n\nIf you send a thoughtful email, one that shows you\u2019re serious and have done some work, to somebody working at the edge of a particular field on something interesting, they\u2019ll probably meet you.Not only do I think it\u2019s possible to start a hard tech startup, it\u2019s actually easier to start a hard startup than it is to start an easier startup.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re doing something that makes people\u2019s eyes gloss over, it\u2019s hard to hire, it\u2019s hard to stake holders to care, etcAlmost every VC firm gives advice they never follow themselves:\n\nThey don\u2019t build differentiated products, they are not network affected businesses, they don\u2019t try to build a brand and a community, and they don\u2019t try to make something that gets better the bigger it getsI think one thing that is an important thing to strive for is being internally driven, being driven to compete with yourself, not with other people. If you compete with other people, you end up in this mimetic trap, and you sort of play this tournament, and if you win, you loseWhen to pivot?\n\nWhen you\u2019ve run out of ideas AND something isn\u2019t working, then it\u2019s a good time to stop\n\nMost great companies start with a great idea, not a pivot. If you look at the track record of pivots, they don\u2019t usually become big companies.Nuclear Energy, why is it unpopular?\n\nBc most ppl are bad at estimating risk. They'll happily breathe in coal smoke all day &amp; then someday die of cancer, &amp; not connect that together. But if there\u2019s a nuclear meltdown &amp; 3 people die, they will march against nuclear energy foreverIf you work hard at the beginning of your career, &amp; you get a little better at what you do every day, every week, every year, &amp; learn more, &amp; meet more people, &amp; get more done, there's a compound effect. It\u2019s better to put that time in at the beginning of your career than the end",

    "full_text": "Summary / takeaways from the book \"The Age of Entitlement\" by Christopher Caldwell.\n\nThe main thesis is that we have two irreconcilable constitutions, and our country is split over which constitution they subscribe to, the one of 1789 or 1964\n\nhttps://t.co/sm2IKrLTHHPassing civil rights act of 1964 (which he supports &amp; which worked!) created legal precedents that expanded beyond its initial scope\n\nMeant to stop segregation in the south, it later set precedents into uplifting other groups beyond race (e.g. immigrants, children, gay rights)Even just within race, it was never meant to expand beyond segregation in the south.\n\nHubert Humphrey said, \u201cIf this results in affirmative action, I\u2019ll eat the bill\u201d \n\nIn the Congressional debate then, you can see ppl mocking others worried about things that later came to passGiven that segregation was such a severe issue, + the rampant racism at the time, it made sense to challenge the prevailing understanding of the 1st Amendment as protecting not just freedom of assembly, but freedom of association.\n\nFor that issue.\n\nBut wasn't so clear for others.The distinction some ppl draw is between individual rights and group rights.\n\nPeople were always \"protected\" as individuals, but today they're protected as groups.\n\nUnclear how to determine which groups need extra gov't protection beyond individual rights &amp; in what capacities.\"Civil Rights Act became the mechanism through which to spread an entire social agenda that the American people did not necessarily vote for, agree to, or even particularly want in the moment..\n\nserved as a precedent for kind of activist government in the in the years that followWhat's big wasn't just the outcomes, it was the legal precedent set by the *process*\n\nIn short, power moved from congress to courts.\n\nBy moving to the courts, activists could get written into law things that were highly unpopular &amp; would never get legislated otherwise.\n\nShortcut.Bilingual education, for example, was implemented tops-down by the courts without any vote or pre-existing law.\n\nThis could have only happened based on legal precedent Civil Rights set.\n\nBypassing congress became an alternative way of conducting politics in the United StatesBy the late 70s, you had something going on where you had a very expensive new constitution, but a public that was not willing to pay for it, &amp; wanted to go back to 1789 constitution.\n\nRaegan ran on this platform &amp; won. But he didnt/couldnt overturn it\n\nInstead he called a truce.Reagan ended up satisfying both constitutions by paying for it via debt.\n\nCombination of Raegan tax cuts plus social programs plus competing with Russia put us in debt. \n\nHe tried to have his cake &amp; eat it too, which worked temporarily, but future generations had to pay for it.\"So overwhelming is the hegemony of this 1964 constitution over the 1788 constitution, that our politics has pretty naturally sorted itself.\n\ninto a party of those who have been helped by the new constitutional developments and the party of those who have been harmed by it.\"In light of all this, it's interesting to think about intersectionality &amp; identity politics as not just cultural or intellectual fashions/belief systems, but also, among other things, legal strategies adaptive to their environments, thanks to 1964.The book then goes on to chronicle how Clinton accelerated it, how not much happened under Bush here, how Obama accelerated it\u2014and the book conveniently ends right before Trump is elected.\n\n/FIN. \n\nInterested in hearing responses to Caldwell's ideas",

    "full_text": "Peter Zeihan is one of the most important thinkers in geopolitics today.\n\nHere are my high level takeaways from his latest book, Disunited Nations, &amp; his recent interviews.\n\nTLDR: US created global order after WWII. US backing out b/c no longer makes sense. Chaos ensues.His books:\n\nAccidental Superpower recounts why U.S. created the global order the way they did &amp; why they are leaving\n\nAbsent Superpower explains the shale revolution &amp; how it accelerates U.S. retreat\n\nDisunited Nations examines who will flourish &amp; struggle in the new (dis)orderThere have been four ages:\n\nImperial: You didn't trade for things. You stole them. (Britain pre U.S.)\n\nPost WW2: U.S. sacrificed economics for security to fight the Russians\n\n3rd Age: U.S. forgot about the sacrifice after cold war\n\n4th age: U.S. woke up\n\nhttps://t.co/vRMc64S81vBush HW had best grasp on foreign policy, but was voted out.\n\nClinton focused domestically.\n\nBush W was distracted by 9/11.\n\nObama got it intellectually, but didn't do much.\n\nFor 30 yrs, we had no coherent foreign policy vision.\n\nAnd now Trump is taking sledgehammer to the order.Post WWII, U.S. effectively said:\n\n\"You don't have to worry about wars or invasions or supply routes or food or energy or anything. The global system will take care of it, the US will subsidize and protect the global system.\"\n\nThis won't be true anymore. They're on their own now.This means that countries that depended on the global order will be screwed: China. Germany. Russia. Iran.\n\nThis means that countries that flourished w/o the global order will flourish: Japan. France. Argentina. Turkey.\n\nU.S. is in best position b/c it was least dependent of allWhat you need to thrive without the global order: \n\n- Perfect geography (mountains good, but oceans better, &amp;  crunchy exterior so ppl can't get to you)\n- Can supply your own food and energy\n- Sustainable population structure\n- Sufficient military resources to protect oneselfThese four countries are odd contenders in some ways:\n\nArgentina: Special case when it comes to national dsyfunction.\n\nTurkey: been out of commission for a century\n\nFrance: Used to be a major power but Germany best them in a global order world.\n\nJapan: U.S. nuked them twiceU.S. in the best position of them all:\n\n- Shale revolution = U.S. energy independent.\n- Only 8% of GDP came from international exchange, so already independent\n- Most balanced population structure\n- Geography: not only is the richest chunk of territory, , it is the most secure.Demographics can be broken into 4 groups:\n\n- Children \n- Young Adults (millennials are holding down the fort when it comes to consumption, at least in U.S)\n- Mature Adults (they work &amp; pay taxes)\n- Retirees (they spend)\n\nIt's important to have balanced ratios between these 4Japan:\n\n- Strong navy\n- Good geography for their military\n- Expert in de-sourcing \"build where you sell\"\n- It has the capacity to go out and take everything that it needs or interface with friendly countries in order to get what it wants.Turkey:\n\n- Largest army in NATO outside of the United States\n- Recent skirmishes make it \"battle tested\"\n- No one who can really hold a candle to it within its own neighborhood.France is the only significant European country that can take care of itself once the United States leaves \n\n- Stable population structure\n- Didn't internationalize manufacturing\n- Doesn't need global market to sell to\n- Doesn't have security concerns Germany hasArgentina:\n\n- Has absolutely everything it needs within its own borders\n- Faces no security threats\n- Has natural resources the rest of world needs (energy, raw materials, food)\n- Good demographics\n- Great geographyWhy can't another country pick up where US left off?\n\n- Germany doesn't have military strength\n- China can't reach beyond the first island chain\n- French are regionally obsessed \n- Japanese don't want to go beyond Pacific\n- British are out of practiceChina is in tough place:\n\n- One child policy led to not enough consumers &amp; workers, &amp; too many retirees\n- Import 85% of their energy, that goes away\n- They can't maintain their food output \n- Low naval capacity\n- Credit &amp; debt bubble\n- Can't keep up food production w/o importsMany ways China can implode in next 10 yrs. E.g:\n\n- Lack of consumers &amp; aging work-force\n- Energy crisis in Middle East\n- Export industry collapses\n\nEvery pillar that China has used to base their entire civilization on is beyond their control, &amp; it's all cracking at the same timeGermany also in tough spot:\n\n- Bad demographics (not enough kids)\n- Not enough consumers\n- No military\n- Precarious geographical position\n- Internationalized manufacturing\n- Energy comes from Russia\n- Dependent on trade for 2/3 of GDPRussia also in a tough spot:\n\n- Bad demographics (too many old &amp; sick)\n- Need to annex countries (Ukraine, Baltic States) just to be physically secure &amp; will do once they're sure NATO &amp; U.S. is goneBritain also in a tough spot:\n\n- Will lose access to European market b/c of Brexit\n- Will beg U.S. for trade deal and accept U.S. demands which will put them in competition w/ Mexico\n- London loses its place as financial center of the world, which it had b/c it represented EUBrazil also in a tough spot:\n\nThe Brazilian situation has only really been successful in an era where global capital costs are low, global transport is safe and global demand for the products is bottomless, which has been true since 1995.\n\nNot anymore.Middle east = chaos.\n\nB/c of shale revolution, everything that's kept the U.S.  bound to this region (i.e. oil) is no more\n\nThat cuts Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia's biggest economic lifeline. They were basically rentier states w/ one commodity\n\nRebuilding that economy will take centuries.Ironic that the countries most hateful of the global order and U.S. management of it (e.g. Iran, Russia, somewhat China) are its biggest beneficiaries, &amp; will suffer the most when it's gone.\n\nAll U.S. has to do to destroy these countries is go home. And that's what they're doing.U.S. Politics\n\nElectoral college incentivizes split into two parties\n\nParties have a choice of casting wide net or forming alliances\n\nDemocrats cast a wide net, Republicans form alliances\n\nDemocrats have more factions, but more voters. Republicans have fewer #s, but more coherentFactions are reshuffling.\n\nTrump has excised national security conservatives, &amp; fiscal/biz voters from republican coalition, &amp; courted new factions (e.g. labor)\n\nDemocrats reoriented too (e.g pro-immigration)\n\nReshuffling is common: https://t.co/G9yCiJAq3XNo matter what, The U.S. is condemned to be an economic, financial, cultural, industrial, &amp; military superpower, per Zeihan. \n\nDecades of bipartisan effort have yet to screw this up yet, &amp; likely won't in 2020.\n\n/FIN\n\nTo learn (much) more, read the book:\n\nhttps://t.co/t1Qhuo2NW2Curious for all feedback &amp; counter-arguments.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed @PeterZeihan's latest interview w/ @patrick_oshag: https://t.co/c7Wv3hwlFI",

Nowadays, most economists think it\u2019s much lower (~0.4%).If you have a growth rate that\u2019s 1% lower, over the course of a bit more than a century, you could have been 3x richer with the higher growth rate. \n\nThat\u2019s a difference between the U.S. today and MexicoI don\u2019t think economic growth is always positive, but America has serious problems. \n\nI\u2019d rather address those problems with more resources, rather than fewer, whether paying off our debts, addressing climate change, or fixing global povertyHow can we enhance growth?\n\nBy making it easier to build homes &amp; move to big cities (enhancing opportunity/geographic mobility)\n\nIt\u2019s extremely difficult to pack up &amp; head somewhere like the Bay Area &amp; just hope to get a job (this was much easier ~50 ago)\n\ncc @placementRelated: In 1980, 40% of people moved somewhere when starting a new career; last year, only 1 in 10 people moved after accepting a new job offer\n\nOne reason for this: costs of movement + housing costs have increased, especially in our most productive regionsFunding science is incredibly important, but there\u2019s little research into\u00a0how\u00a0exactly we should be doing so\u00a0\n\ne.g. in 1980, NIH spent 12x more dollars on researchers under 40 than those over 50. Today, this has inverted \u2013 they spend 5x more dollars on ppl over 50 than ppl over 40Over the past 100 years, there\u2019s been tremendous progress in medical research\n\nThe average life expectancy has increased by ~1/4 year of every year, &amp; relatively linearly\n\nBut, Tyler brings up a good point:\u00a0We use to spend a few % points of our GDP on healthcare, now we spend 18%All of the following have grown linearly over the last 100 years: # of PhDs, totals $ spent on funded science, and # of published papers\u00a0\n\nBut no corresponding increase in terms of scientific progress.When NY decided to build a subway in 1900,  they opened 23 subway stations in 5 yrs for ~$1B\n\nWhen NY decided to build a 2nd Avenue subway in 2000, 3 stations in 17 yrs &amp; spent $4.5 billion doing so\n\nProductivity in regards to subway construction decreased by a factor of 40The percentage of Americans who think their kid\u2019s lives will be better than their\u2019s has been declining since World War II\n\nThis lost sense of optimism about the future results in people investing less and not working as hardIf you look at a list of American universities, the list of the top schools in the 1920s &amp; those today is virtually the same, except we\u2019ve added on California. \n\n7 of the top 25 schools started within 30 year period. \n\nIn contrast, the list of the top 10 cos changes every decadeProcedures for tenure in the top 50 research universities hasn\u2019t changed much at all\n\nThere\u2019s not enough experimentation with how you reward people. \n\nMore schools should experiment with different kinds of tenure or reward people more on the basis of practical impactRent, healthcare, education, etc have skyrocketed in the U.S., but we can learn from others\n\nIn Singapore, healthcare spending is only 4% of their GDP, and they have a slightly higher life expectancy\n\nIn Japan, the\u00a0NIMBY problem\u00a0(the cost of getting an apartment) is mostly solvedHow to bring housing costs down?\n\nIt\u2019s  easier to move bits around than atoms \u2013 advancements in tech like AR &amp; VR will enable ppl to be where they want to be without having to move there physically\n\nHyperloop\u00a0will expand the \u201cradius\u201d of cities, allowing ppl to live further awayBay Bridge and\u00a0Golden Gate Bridge starting in 1933, finished within 4 years and then we\u00a0built island in 18 months. \n\nNot possible today\u00a0in 18 months.\u00a0\n\n\nFrance in 5 years\u00a0high speed rail, CA projected 25 year projects for high speed rail.Why does Zuck think education and healthcare are too expensive?\n\nEducation is subsidized by government, which puts low pressure to decrease costs of education\n\n\nAmerican value of doing everything\u00a0you can do to help someone who is sick is root of cause of over spending in US",

How do we get back to an accelerating progressing world of science and technology? How do we reduce violence?\n\nUtopia: Cheaper energy sources. AI. Robotics, Space program. Nanotechnology, Cures for all diseases. New cities.His claim: economic growth has stalled. \n\nWe've had progress around tech, around this narrow cone of progress around the world of bits, but not atoms.\n\nThe iPhones that distract us from our environment also distract us from how strangely old &amp; unchanging our environment is.1973 Test: Go into a room and, besides the phones, try to notice what would be different from 1973.\n\nWe attend schools and sit in classrooms that are pretty much like parents &amp; grandparents. We live in houses not unlike theirs and drive in cars not unlike theirs.Deceleration in:\n\n- Biotech\n- Energy\n- Cleantech\n- Transportation\n- Food\n- Nanotech  \n- Education\n- Healthcare\n- Construction\n- Gov't\n\nAcceleration in:\n\n- Tech\n\nIT innovation hasn't been isn't enough to save the country, not even enough to save California.Tech itself isn't immune to stagnation.\n\nGoogle &amp; Amazon companies are worth perhaps 2-3x as much as all technology companies in the US combined created since the year 2000. \n\nComputer Rust Belt - Cisco, Dell, HP, etcUS has taken the future for granted, and has become too gullible.\n\nSavings rate of minus 6%. If you include government deficit spending, people think the future will take care of itself.\n\nOne bubble after another where people have been promised that the future will be fantasticWhy has this happened? Few different reasons:\n\nSome say low hanging fruit has been picked.\n\nPeter Thiel says it's something in the culture that's made us less ambitious, more risk-averse, scared to take ambitious swings\n\nhttps://t.co/T3cX1R3qpuThe easiest way to show this is if you look at all the movies that come out of Hollywood, name science fiction films that portrays the technological future in a positive light. It's often Terminator, Black Mirror, The Matrix, Avatar, etc\n\nThis is good. It means it can be changed.Surveys show that the majority of young people think they will be less well off their parents in the US. \n\nin Western Europe, even a smaller minority that thinks they will be better off than their parents.\n\n\"The Complacent Class\": https://t.co/nYh3UhyrZySV Propaganda says the opposite -- things are happening too much, people will be left behind.\n\nThis doesn't show up the data. 3.5% unemployment\n\nUBI is self-congratulatory &amp; pre-mature.\n\nIt's a trick to divert attention from the fact that we haven't been innovating enough.\"I'm always nervous whenever we're too optimistic or too pessimistic about the future, because it means that it doesn't matter what you do, if you're optimistic, the future will take care of itself. If you're pessimistic, we're headed the apocalypse. \n\nWhen really it's up to us.\"Climate change politics itself is anti-technological, anti-human. We need less people because people are bad. We need less tech b/c tech is bad.\n\nInstead of tech being the way out, and people being what creates tech \n\nhttps://t.co/xkbe2fU4vKPension funds try to make ~8.5% return a year so that everyone has enough to retire. If they don't get them, the people are screwed.\n\nThe only way you can get those kinds of returns, is if you have extraordinary compound exponential growth in science &amp; tech in the developed worldA big LP was telling Thiel they had 5% in VC and thought it too much.\n\nPT responds -- if the 5% doesn't return b/c not enough innovation, it's not the 5% you should worry about. \n\nIt's the 95% you should worry about, b/c it won't return either w/o innovations in science &amp; tech.The only way our societies have worked for at least 250 yrs is by economic growth.\n\nParliament democracies are built on an expanding pie that they can continue subdividing. Once the pie's no longer expanding, then everything turns zero-sum. (1930s was a bad decade for growth...)We need a return to long-term thinking.\n\nWe are too focused on hitting # s for the quarter, or winning that next election, to focus on 20 year issues. \n\nUS is better than China in every dimension except for this-- thinking long-term.We've had this extraordinary history of bubbles in the last few decades which clearly had a psychosocial component where people were not thinking very much for themselves. Internet bubble in 90s, housing/finance in 2000s, gov't bubble now.Often, these things were characterized by extreme lack of critical thinking, deferring to groupthink\n\nThus, suspicion is always when there's speech that is completely forbidden &amp; Q's that aren't allowed to be asked, normally you should assume that those things are simply true.Silicon Valley has a conformity problem. Intellectual monoculture.  \n\nSilicon Valley 1997: Think different  \n\nSilicon Valley. 2018: Think the sameThe US is living in an increasingly competitive world. \n\nMarginal tax rates at 40/50%, relative to 10% in other countries.\n\nThe focus on whether rich are paying their fair share is to miss the bigger point of whether US can compete globally.",

Apple is employees &amp; investors, but it\u2019s also an entire ecosystem of goods &amp; services around its products, most of which it doesn\u2019t own. \n\nIt\u2019s the productivity benefits its customers get, millions of them small businesses.It's the second &amp; third order economic growth &amp; job creation in the communities in which it operates.\n\nIt's the training that it gives its employees and members of its ecosystem which grow human capital.\n\nIt\u2019s the education &amp; entertainment people get from the products themselves.Best argument *against* free trade?\n\nThere are many ppl in the US who aren't capable of adapting to a post-manufacturing employment\u00a0world.\n\nAnd so the choices are UBI or protectionism, &amp; latter is better because it's better to have ppl working than getting paid to do\u00a0nothing.What about security?\n\nWell, the more economically intertwined we all are, the less likely war\u00a0is.\n\n\"The best hedge against civilizational collapse is civilizational advancement, and entanglement.\"\n\nCoronavirus, however, could present unique challenges to this theory.What about China?\n\nThey're bad actors in this arena.\n\nThey're also likely growing in spite of their policies not b/c of them.\n\nThey are fostering domestic job growth at the expense of the quality of living for their citizens.\n\nFor them, that's a tradeoff they seem to be OK\u00a0with.Trade was also a huge debate in the 1980s/1990s as well, except then, instead of vs China, it was Japan, &amp; later\u00a0Korea.\n\n\"Competitiveness\" was the reason of the time for this topic, the idea being that we need to \"compete &amp; win\" vs Japan or they would \"compete &amp; win\" vs\u00a0the U.S.When people attack trade, what they are really unhappy with is the shifting composition of the underlying\u00a0economy\n\n+ they can't hold it back, since that's the result of actual technological progress resulting in shifting consumer wants &amp;\u00a0needs\n\nAnd so they go after the\u00a0foreignersPeople use trade as a tool to solve other problems, and those solutions end up making things\u00a0worse.\n\nAnd so using international trade to try to address systemic issues around the middle class is unlikely to work *even if* it is a logically sound thing to\u00a0doTalks &amp; readings that educated me, in addition to conversations w/ smart friends:\n\nhttps://t.co/9guCqsiwY0\n\nhttps://t.co/KWHB4xgMlH\n\nhttps://t.co/CvK3vhWy20\n\nhttps://t.co/oEZOp4uvsQ\n\nhttps://t.co/B1RjVuhH0Z\n\nhttps://t.co/3AvmNIiVrK\n\nhttps://t.co/2tcUKkfg1g",

The labor cost to build a home is actually\u00a0higher today\u00a0than it was in the 1960s.In California, just transactional efficiency isn't enough. Why? It actually raises price.\n\nYou also need construction productivity.\n\nIn particular, there've been promising advances in two areas: modular housing and so-called tiny homes.Real estate agents have a bit of a racket going\n\nIf you're selling a house, it's 3%. If you're buying a house, it's 3%. They legally can't take less, regardless of work needed\n\nWeirdly, they're incentivized for you to pay more for a house, rather than less. Should be the opposite https://t.co/O9Xe79jxgBWhy does it currently suck to buy a house?\n\nAmong other reasons, if you're taking out a mortgage, you have to get approved, which can take 45 days. \n\nWhich means you can lose out on the house to someone who can pay right away, even if you were willing to pay more for it. https://t.co/P75pVKp4w9Companies will buy &amp; sell homes on behalf of ppl\n\nFlyhomes buys the house *for* you.

This is nature's way of telling you that these algorithms have escaped our control. The fact that the people who are in a position know what the algorithm does, can't even protect themselves...We are not built to be happy. \n\nAnd therefore, pursuing happiness, as if we were built to be happy is a hazard. We should be pursuing something else. \n\nWe should recognize that happiness is a carrot on a stick, that evolution built into us in order to get us to pursue objectives.Metaphorical Truth:\n\nA belief that is factually wrong, but that if you behave as if it were correct, you'd come out ahead of where you would be\n\nWhat makes a concept useful evolutionarily is not that it is accurate, but that it's advantageous.\n\nhttps://t.co/nTEmneXBaDReligion is metaphorically true.\n\nIf it wasn't, if it was useless, than those who simply didn't believe them would have a massive advantage b/c they weren't spending all this time on elaborate rituals, etc. It must provide some evolutionary advantage. It's not just a mind virus.On excesses of cancel culture:\n\nWhat you want is a system in which ppl are honorable. \n\nif you allow honorable ppl to be skewered simply b/c someone decides to go after them, you're going to eliminate the courageous ppl from the system.\n\nDon't let the innocent go down w/ the shipOn humor: \n\nWe don't even have a good evolutionary explanation of what humor is\n\nAnd so we're trying to navigate what the rules of it should be without even talking about what its function is.\n\nhypothesis: laughter is the sound of comprehension.That is to say: \n\nHumor treads at the edge, the fringe of consciousness, and that what happens when a comic finds a truly funny joke, is that they're unearthing a truth that people are only kind of aware of but it's so universal that the whole room suddenly grasps it.Humor is the mechanism by which we sort out the gray area\n\nIf you cut that off and say, 'you can't say that', well, then, how exactly do we figure out where the line is? \n\nOne has to step beyond the line to figure out where the line is,&amp; if the room laughs, now you know somethingCRISPR gives us the typewriter, it allows us to edit, maybe it's the word processor, but what we don't have is the Rosetta Stone. \n\nhow can we edit the computer if we don't understand the source code?On evolution:\n\nCulture is every bit as biological as genes are. \n\nHard to distinguish b/c many things have components that live in both spaces. \n\nBut you have to realize that most of what we are is the product of an evolutionary adaptive process, irrespective of  genes or cultureUtopia\n\nAnytime you try to maximize a single parameter, every other value you have will crash as a result\n\nBut once you accept that, you can say, you really like liberty, but you're not ready to surrender on equality\n\nYou can have 80% of both, if you accept imperfection in eitherComplex dynamic systems are always about tensions between competing values. I mean, this is how your body works. Your temperature is maintained by something that looks out for it being too hot and too cold, &amp; it's constantly pushing parameters around that you're not even aware ofIf you build a rule into your personality, where you say anything that is positive from the perspective of equity is something you're in favor of, then you can be easily manipulated, because all that has to happen is somebody needs to wrap that label around something noxious.Tribalism:\n\nThere's playful versions of tribalism that we wouldn't want to get over (e.g sports?), but clearly when we take it too far it becomes fanaticism. \n\nIt's hard: The worst thing about us, the same parameter that makes a mother love her children, makes ppl commit genocideAnd so when ppl are involved in these tribal movements, they're operating automatically, they're pursuing ends that something inside them tells them to pursue\n\nAnd if they realized that sometimes ppl who felt just like they did put other people in gas chambers, maybe they'd stopWisdom involves, I would argue, delayed gratification, unpacking the issue carefully is the way not to get sucked into these movements that are pursuing ends that we should never wish for.Evolution:\n\nThe first thing to do is to get over the idea that you want to fulfill evolutions wish for you, it's an absurd wish.\n\nI am not exaggerating to say that every single creature that has ever evolved has the identical same purpose, which means it can't be a very good one.We must recognize that we are in an odd spot evolutionarily:\n\nEvolution has awarded us the capacity to evaluate our purpose &amp; reject it, which we should do right away. \n\nHaving rejected it, we can substitute other things. And that leads right to the Q of well, what to substitute?Most ppl agree on basic values, they will disagree about what policies ought to be used to enact them\n\nWe'd rather pursue common values than we would pursue our evolutionary program, which is not honorable, can't be defended, and is ultimately a danger to our persistence.You have two lefts: the authoritarian left &amp; libertarian left:\n\nThose that wish to end oppression &amp; those that wish to turn the tables of oppression\n\nThere are those that want to use enforce equality of outcome vs enable equality of opportunity\n\n(Of course, devil's in details...)\"Where's my progressivism?

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways from Albert Wenger's \n\"World After Capital\" &amp; interviews.\n\nRead the real thing here: https://t.co/cpkbZWRcQWWhat does it mean to be human today?\n\nEmotions, consciousness, sure, but ultimately it's the ability to contribute to the knowledge loop (learn, create, share).\n\nThe idea that I can read a book or see a piece of art that someone else wrote in a different place and time period.When AI can contribute to knowledge loop\u2014what makes humans special then?\n\nQualia: when I look at this orange chair over there, I have a feeling of what it feels like to be looking at an orange chair\n\nWe get the brain at constituent level, but not emergent phenomena level.Every age of humanity has a defining scarcity.\n\nHumanity then invents tech that shifts that scarcity.\n\nAgriculture solved for food, scarcity shifted to arable land\n\nEnlightenment gave us industrial age, scarcity shifted from land to capital\n\nScarcity in knowledge age is attentionChange from forager to agrarian:\n\nMigratory -&gt; sedentary\nPolygamous -&gt; monogamous\nFlat societies -&gt; hierarchical\nAnimistic religions -&gt; god religions\n\nChange from agrarian to industrial:\n\nCountry -&gt; city\nLarge families -&gt; nuclear families\nCommons -&gt; private propertyThe need for food didn't go away. We just filled it in more efficient ways.\n\nSame thing for capital. It's not like we no longer need to build houses and cars and so forth. It's just that we can build sufficient housing and cars for everybody overtime.Fire can be used to cook, but it can be used to burn down. \n\nAI can be used to diagnose disease, but it can also manipulate people.\n\nAgriculture made Athenian democracy possible, but also dark ages.\n\nIndustrial society made democracy possible, but it also made Stalin possible.Digital machines are different from industrial machines in two ways:\n\nZero Marginal Cost &amp; Universality.\n\nEconomics wasn't built on zero marginal cost, a lot of theories break down. \n\nThe constraint in the last one was capital, this one is attention.Ppl used to have a clear path: go to college, get a job, have a long standing career, have a place nicer than parents.\n\nNo longer. We don't yet have a replacement path for people wanting predictability/stability.  MAGA is evidence.\n\nNeed fundamental shifts, not just incremental.Capitalism it does an amazing job at turning financial capital into physical capital, which is why we have all these extraordinary capabilities\n\nOf course, many people are still poor, albeit less. But as a society, we have enough to feed people. It's a distribution problem.Capitalism works well when you can have markets that can have prices. \n\nBut what is the price for you to discover your purpose in life? \n\nNo market mechanism will solve that. \n\nThat's an attention problem that we need to allocate attention to without a market mechanism.Collective action problems:\n\nWhat is the prize for humanity being able to deflect an incoming asteroid detected? (Or prepare for a possible pandemic?) \n\nThere is no market mechanism that will allocate collective attention to this problem.Solutions to our problems need to come from knowledge age paradigm, not industrial age.\n\nGov't providing job - industrial age\n\nGov't providing UBI - knowledge age\n\nWhat will people do instead of jobs?\n\nResearch\nSelf-care\nFamily/friends\nEnvironment\nMake art\nCultivate knowledgeRole of capital in knowledge age?\n\nin 1780, ~80% of human attention in the US was dedicated just to feeding ourselves. Today, that's like sub 5%,.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of human attention is on economic activity. Capital will still have a role, but maybe we can shift it to ~20%.Types of freedoms\n\nEconomic - ~UBI of $800 a month will let ppl get out of job loop\n\nInformational - Data sovereignty \n\nPsychological freedom - no longer being slaves to whatever stimuli are thrown at us.Network effects are too strong -- they have turned normal distributions into power laws\n\nHard q's:\n\nWhat's the right governance for those networks? \n\nWhat is the power that I should have as a participant in those networks relative to the owners and operators of the network?\"shift the balance of power back towards or some of it anyhow, back to the edge, we need to figure out how to give each and every one of us computers that we control, and that lets us interact with the other systems through computation that we control ourselves. \"Everything should be an API.\n\nI shouldn't have to ask Facebook or Twitter for permission to program Facebook or Twitter, I should just be able to do it.\n\nEverything is programmable, everything is composable, everything is remixable.e.g. If Amazon had it...I could have powerful bots operated on my behalf scanning Amazon, comparing Amazon to three other sites automatically, it would give startup sites a real opportunity b/c machines could check 2nd sites on my behalf.",

More like 10% on it setting up the basics (\"set it &amp; forget it\")\n\nWhereas referrals can work day oneUsually don't like relying on paid acquisition initially, if you can avoid it. Most big &amp; durable companies didn't rely on it\n\nAvoiding it builds the discipline of figuring out viral growth mechanics\n\nUnless you prove that if you spend $1, you get $5, &amp; you don't have high churn.B2B:\n\nAre you selling into an individual decision maker who then is going to scale the product out inside the organization? \n\nOr is it a bottoms up type product where one part of the org adopts it organically (often free) &amp; then seeds usage inside of the rest of the org.Metrics that matter:\n\nEarly on, quality over quantity metrics. (e.g. retention)\n\n50% or 10% long term retention matters more in the beginning than user growth rate.\n\nDAU matters if you require specific use cases\n\nIt's less \"can this get users\" &amp; more \"can it keep them...+ paying\"Cohort analysis:\n\nIsolate users by cohort so you can analyze how behaviors change as time goes on and as you change the product.\n\nYou can identify if there are natural attrition points (\"graduation rates\") and if your changes unlock new behavior.Calculating LTV w/ only a few months of data isn't very constructive.\n\nWhat people are getting at is \"How will this product grow over time\"\n\nSo you want to say \"Here's what it'll look like at scale, here's what our flywheel looks like, etc\n\nhttps://t.co/f91Z1ENsNBPayback periods sometimes better than LTV/CAC\n\nMeaning how if I spend $1, how quickly do I get it back in not just revenue but contribution margin\n\n&amp; the reason for that is it's hard to build compounding growth on a paid channel w/o a ton of $ unless you have fast payback periodsWhat you're really trying to ask yourself is \"can I reinvest these dollars into more growth?\" \n\nAnd if it takes you a year or two to get those dollars back then you're counting on another source of capital to fund your growth.Companies over-focus too much on month-over-month growth before nailing the product (e.g retention)\n\nPlus, in the beginning, the #s are so small you convince yourself it's working. But if retention isn't there it won't continue.Focusing exclusively on 10% MOM growth might force you to over index on acquisition when you should be focusing on nailing the product\n\nIt might make it hard to tell the difference between real growth &amp; fake growth\n\n/FIN. \n\nThx to @far33d @JeffChang30 for convos that led to this",

Physical (e.g. landline telephones)\n2. Protocol (e.g. Ethernet)\n3. Personal Utility (e.g. iMessage, WhatsApp)\n4. Personal (e.g. Facebook)\n5. Market Network (e.g. HoneyBook, AngelList)\n6. Marketplace (e.g. eBay, Craigslist)\n7. Platform (e.g. iOS)\" https://t.co/qF3XS4JzOE\"13 network effects continued:\n\n8. Asymptotic Marketplace (e.g. Uber, Lyft)\n9. Data (e.g. Waze, Yelp!)\n10. Tech Performance (e.g. Bittorrent,Skype)\n11. Language (e.g. Google, Xerox)\n12. Belief (currencies, religions)\n13. Bandwagon (e.g. Slack, Apple)\"\n\nhttps://t.co/FMyUW8VzAHTypically, the higher the density of a network, the more powerful its network effects are.\n\nFocus on the \"red-hot-center\" of a network or marketplace \u2014 the densest, highest activity part.\n\nFocus on the product features &amp; language to get other users to behave more like that group. https://t.co/Rn7qDNg6ZLCritical mass: The critical mass of a network refers to the point at which the value produced by the network exceeds the value of the product itself and of competing products. This can happen at different times depending on the type of a network. https://t.co/mjbzhooszeEvolution of network effects:\n\n1st: Broadcast: network value is proportional to its viewers (e.g Yahoo)\n\n2nd: Metcalfe's law: value is proportional to N squared (eg FB)\n\n3rd: Reed\u2019s law: value can scale exponentially b/c of subgroups formed (e.g vertical networks) https://t.co/npWgggtmsm@sarahtavel stresses importance of users completing \"Core Actions\"\n\n- The more you use the product, the better the experience gets\n\n- The more you use the product, the harder it is to leave\n\n- Conversely, you don't want your product to be easy to switch\n\nhttps://t.co/UlR5CR78aeReal Identity strengthens network effects.\n\nPeople say Facebook beat Myspace because FB leveraged real identity.\n\nPer Sarah's theory above, when you put your real name onto some social economy (\"followers\" \"friends\"), it becomes harder to leave. https://t.co/5100Lae5nHNetwork effects are important because they are the best form of defensibility, and thus value creation, in the digital world (the three other major defensibilities are brand, embedding, and scale).\n\nMost big businesses have network effects, but not all.Defensibility without network effects:\n\n- Scale enables negotiating leverage (e.g MoviePass), amortization of fixed assets (Netflix), &amp; product density (LimeBike)\n\n- Brand (e.g. Coinbase)\n\n- High switching cost b/c embedding, habit, or personal data\n\nhttps://t.co/NfmsSN6cwwEconomies of scale: As well-run companies get bigger, their per unit production costs get cheaper\n\nIn other words, more users means greater volume, which means cheaper prices from suppliers, which means lower prices for customers, which means higher conversion rates for ads, etc https://t.co/m8mybl7XG3Hidden network effects\n\n- Slow Networks: companies where network effects take a while to build (e.g. Lambda School, YC)\n\n- Latent Networks: companies that first focus on single player experiences before introducing multi-player (e.g. Roam Research)\n\nhttps://t.co/SYvSAG9HisNetwork effects that peak \n\nSocial Networks: after a certain point, turns into reverse network effect\n\nRidesharing: Once multiple platforms hit relative liquidity, users don't care (supply commoditized)\n\nOther reverse nfx: https://t.co/azSKwJJ3x0\n\nhttps://t.co/dfzdTNSJSMMarketplaces should reduce search costs &amp; make matching easier.\n\nWhen it doesn't, each additional user causes more challenge in discovery, resulting in decision fatigue (e.g dating apps)\u201cHomogeneous supply\u201d marketplaces hit an asymptote in nfx, where value to users plateaus w greater market depth (LimeBike)\n\nFor heterogeneous marketplaces, there is no asymptote because every node on the supply side is different and potentially can add greater value (e.g. Airbnb) https://t.co/R9aAs3VNJ6How to avoid multi-tenanting (users using multiple products, e.g. Lyft &amp; Uber):\n\nLayer on functionality that can obviate the need for another product. (e.g. Uber layering on Uber Eats to prevent Lyft Growth, FB layering on stories to stymie Snap's growth)\n\nhttps://t.co/gupoBBTvPjData + network effects \u2260 data network effects\n\nSometimes more data is worse: instead of getting stronger, the data moat erodes as the corpus grows\n\nIt's a data network effects when data improves the algorithm that improves the user experience.\n\nhttps://t.co/4krzZc65BzMost data doesn\u2019t produce a real data network effect, and most data network effects aren\u2019t that powerful even once established.\n\nA data network effect is when a product\u2019s value grows as a result of more usage via the accretion of data.\n\nhttps://t.co/lrC3vG1Ht4Network effects even determine your life:\n\n- who you marry\n- who your friends are\n- what job you choose\n- where you live\n\nhttps://t.co/PBjFYyMbSm https://t.co/i4YPy4Ln5kNFX are stronger than ever before, but it's not too late\n\nMany spaces aren't yet winner take all (e.g ride sharing, food delivery, healthcare, education) so there's still lots of room to build nfx businesses.\n\nAlmost half the world has smart phones now.

Environments are like cheat codes\n\nIf you can surround yourself with builders, you will have a higher chance of becoming a builder\n\nThe physical environment that you are in, can affect your motivation, effort, and successKick off the positive feedback loop which gets you innately curious &amp; willing to explore your interests\n\ne.g Schwarzenegger only got started down his path after going to a gym in Austria where he won a weightlifting trophy\n\nThat positive feedback propelled him on his path in lifeA lot of what drives curiosity is you ppl like it\u2019s okay to go explore a particular direction (b/c of feedback)\n\nThe world needs more people who follow their curiosity\n\nBut there\u2019s a shortage of positive feedback today, thus reducing the # of ppl who explore their curiositiesNutrition, Exercise, Sleep, etc:\n\nSelf-experimentation is more important than the results\n\nThe point \u2013 Don\u2019t wake up at 5 AM because so and so Twitter guru also wakes up at that time, do what works for youUltimate feedback loop\u2013\u201cAm I doing things that seem good to the local circle of ppl whose opinions I care about?\u201d\n\nWhat ppl think about you, especially the ppl you respect, is a very important signal as to whether you're on the right path. &amp; it has a long-standing tribal historyBe focused, but also embrace 10-20% serendipity\n\nHave your own iPhone moment: Focus on doing something that may not seem intuitive, that may not align with the metrics you\u2019re collecting, and that may seem a little crazy, but has the potential of really changing your lifeThe best leaders are innately\u00a0interested in the lives/problems of the people they lead \u2013 they have a deep sense of empathy\n\nBy learning about the personal stories of those you lead, you\u2019re better able to design an environment that works well for themInformation diet may actually drive your food diet, and it may be more important.\n\nFiction books inject, at a much deeper level, information about how the world worksHumans walk around with a basic firewall up to a lot of the information we\u2019re exposed to\n\nBut for a select few ppl (our tribe &amp; those we look up to) \u2013 that firewall gets dimmed\n\nSo to change the way you think, surround yourself with ppl you want to be like.If you want to poach someone, try it when they come back from vacation\n\nOften when people come back to work from a vacation, their minds are much more open to other job alternatives\n\nThis is also why companies have offsites: new environments open our minds up to new possibilitiesHappiness to me is flow + knowing you moved the needle of the planet.I think it\u2019s the struggle that really makes you successful as a company, whereas if you have the curse of plenty very early on, it\u2019s really hard to develop that right organizational muscle in order to be successfulIn the venture world, funds compete for a limited amount of deals so there isn\u2019t much cooperation (zero-sum game)\n\nBut in hedge fund deals, people work together and even have company off-sites with other firms (positive sum game)\n\nPlay infinite games.Religion should be respected even if you don\u2019t believe in it because it's still here after so many years\n\nReligion strengthens tribal bonds. It connects people who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily connect with one another\n\nHow can we create a new religion to encourage people to work together?It's criminal that we ask teenagers to wake up at 6:45\n\nAdults want to wake up early, but children do not. I think school should start at 11 o\u2019clock. That alone may change the world.\n\nStudies have shown that children need to wake up later than adultsIt is really important to make feedback a positive experience for other people because if you don\u2019t, they won\u2019t give you any.\n\nYou want the critical feedback because you want data on how to be better.",

No price transparency. Principal agent problems abound.Why is healthcare so hard?\n\nSo many middle men.\n\nEnterprise = b2b\nConsumer = b2c\nHealthcare = b2b2R2Pc2P2c\n\nBiopharma (Development) \u2014&gt; Regulator (FDA) \u2014&gt; Payer (insurance, employers, gov\u2019t ) \u2014&gt; Channel (pharmacy) -&gt; Provider (physicians, hospitals) \u2014&gt; customer (patient)\n\nh/t a16zWhy is healthcare so hard?\n\nIt's like any startup, except everything is 10x harder:\n\nRegulation is tighter, incumbents are more protected, customers move slower, and behaviors are harder to change. \n\nAnd barely any early adopters to sell to! \n\nWhich is why many go full-stack.Malay Gandhi wrote a fantastic piece about why there haven't been enough unicorns--they've played too close to existing system. \n\nhttps://t.co/W2wzhzPIL1\n\nCompanies need to own outcomes. See attached. https://t.co/pas7jrdogvLife science industry is the exception to the rule: you can build a huge business working w/ existing industry.\n\nopportunities in every part of the value chain from drug discovery, clinical trials, commercialization, production, fulfillment, drug pricing, etc.Initially, companies set out to triage things out of existing healthcare ecosystem and build a layer around them.\n\nNext wave focusing on reimagining care from within or from inside out.\n\nStill, more than 30% of costs flow through hospitals. Can unbundle.Unbundling hospitals:\n\n- Most expensive part of healthcare is labor.\n\n- Find ways for physicians to get out of hospitals and closer to patients (e.g. handle back-office, create lower-cost models of running an office)Future of providers involves bifurcation:\n\nEither doctors will go sell to major hospital systems.\n\nOr they'll go w/ insurance companies &amp; cut value based deals.\n\nBig opportunity to help doctors do the latter.\n\nAlso: Virtual clinics (virtual fertility, mental health, pain)Payers:\n\n- 10% of patients account for &gt;50% of costs\n\n- Don't have updated provider networks\n\n- Tough time managing fraud\n\n- Don't have advanced way to do risk segmentation\n\nAre notoriously tough customers so have to make sure can integrate easily w/ existing way of doing things.Consumer: \n\nWhen are we going to see something that  combines telemedicine, wearables, and at home diagnostics so you can properly triage patients and then escalate them properly to the right domain of care for that level of severity?\n\nWhen are we gonna get indexed health data?Consumer:\n\nWhen are we going to see a d2c company that genetically tests you when you\u2019re born and then focuses on optimizing your well-being, mental cognition, and physical abilities for the rest of your life?\n\nhttps://t.co/saQa0UWWIOConsumer:\n\nImagine taking genomic data &amp; lab data and combining it with information from your Apple Watch or another wearable and some app telling you that your blood sugar is low or that you're dehydrated or that you haven't slept enough or that you need to eat X.Our view of healthcare is so narrow.\n\nIt's optimized for acute care (when you're sick, or something's broken), not preventive care.\n\nIn theory, apps like Foursquare (food), Strava (exercise) &amp; Tinder (relationships) should be tied to our health profiles.Build inside or outside the system?\n\nYou either have to be:\n\n1) full stack (take on the entire vertical of pharmacy, clinical trials, insurance, etc.) \n\nor 2) barely touching the existing healthcare system\n\nFramework h/t @nikillinit:\"If you want to simplify the pharmacy, then you have to be a delivery system, distributor, &amp; PBM all in one.\n\nif you want to do insurance, you have to get into care itself.\n\nif you want to be in the clinical trial space, you have to be someone that runs the clinical trial itself\"\"OR, you operate tangentially next to healthcare space\n\neither in primary care (one medical, nurx etc.) which doesn't have to touch the existing system unless it absolutely needs to, which means it can build its own systems in house\"Another framework:\n\nEither you commit to going through heavy amounts of proof building (clinical trials, pilots, publishing in peer reviewed journals) OR you go direct to consumer and gather millions of users like any other consumer app. Both brutally hard.One Medical for X:\n\n- One Medical worked b/c it was a great perk for employers to offer their employees.\n\n- Consumers won't pay for any commodity specialist. It has to be something where there's high variance in quality (e.g diabetes, musculoskeletal, mental health, dental)Nurx for X:\n\nTraditional mail order pharmacy brands haven't innovated on distribution. They don't have direct relationship w/ consumers.\n\nNew brands are segmenting against category as a result (Hims &amp; ED, Brightside &amp; mental health, Nurx &amp; women's health)EMR:\n\nEpic will continue to dominate for a long time b/c hard to rip out (exception here is primary care)\n\nStandard value of Epic is not to make a doctor's life easier. It's to do revenue cycle management properly.Opportunity: Legitimize &amp; Curate alternative-eastern medicine.\n\nBig demand from consumers, a lot of it is snake oil.\n\nA company can solve for access, quality, and guidance.Distribution:\n\nSo many great products fail in healthcare b/c no one cares.\n\nIt must fit within an existing budget item or reimbursement code that they provide to the market around the service.\n\nSelf-insured employer channel is crowdedMany companies struggle going d2c, then try to go b2b, but typically fail b/c they just haven't solved a strong enough pain point for the consumer. That's why d2c didn't work.Paraphrasing Cunningham's law, which explains why I post some of these: \"The best way to get the right answer on the internet isn't to ask general questions.

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways from Samo Burja's \"Great Founder Theory\" &amp; other writings: Thread \ud83d\udc47\n\nGreat Founder Theory: https://t.co/THdfyDdeHg\n\nOther writing: https://t.co/UVMU3RkrDTDiff theories of history:\n\nGreat man theory looks at history through the lens of the individuals who shaped it.\n\nTechnological determinism explain events in terms of the technologies that enabled them.\n\nProgressivism looks at history through the lens of increasing social justice.Functional institutions are the exception, not the norm.\n\nSociety flourishes by having functional institutions\n\nGreat Founder Theory focuses on how great founders create (or rebuild) functional institutions that enable (sustained) flourishingA functional institution can outright solve a problem for a civilization. \n\nIt might, for example, complete the construction of infrastructure so important it changes the course of economic development for centuries to come, such as ancient China\u2019s grand canal or...solving COVID.\"Like many things, people\u2019s impact on the world follows a Pareto-like distribution, with the most impactful people having a far greater impact than the rest.\n\nThe creation of functional institutions is the means by which people are hugely impactful.\"It's easier to start from scratch than to rebuild from within.\n\nInstitutions often resist change, and diagnosing dysfunction is hard, as it usually has many causes\n\nThis explains Thiel\u2019s law: a founder\u2019s best shot at creating a functional institution is to get it from the start.Live &amp; Dead players:\n\nA live player is a person or a tightly coordinated group of people that is able to innovate (startup mentality).\n\nA dead player is a person or a group of people that is working off a script, incapable of doing new things. (incumbent mentality)Understanding a player is dead means you can replace them without much of a fight.\n\nUnderstanding a player is live means you can collaborate with them and you should be mindful of their path to power\n\nTo revive a dead player, you have to displace an existing power structureWhat happens to institution when great founder dies?\n\nSuccession challenge.\n\nPower succession: Who takes over\n\nSkill succession: How do they gain the skills.\n\nRome solved this by \"adopting\" someone early and ensuring their trainingIf the succession problem is unsolved, the only process of institutional reform is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as creative destruction.\n\nThat we praise this process indicates we've resigned ourselves to failed succession.We should temper our enthusiasm for intense political and economic competition and instead develop a greater appreciation for the importance of successful succession. \n\nThis change would go far in remedying contemporary institutional sclerosis and stagnation.The purpose of a bureaucracy is to save the time of a competent person.\n\nPut another way: to save time, some competent people will create a system that is meant to do exactly what they want \u2014 nothing more and nothing lessCreate a bureaucracy when you are both \n\n(a) trying to do something that you do not have the capacity to do on your own, and \n\n(b) unable to find a competent, aligned person to handle the project for you. \n\nBureaucracies ameliorate the problem of talent and alignment scarcity.Bureaucrats are expected to act according to a script, or a set of procedures \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\n\nOwners don\u2019t trust that bureaucrats will be competent or aligned enough to act in line with the owner\u2019s wishes of their own accord.\n\nIf low trust, minimize downside (&amp; thus cap upside)Other methods of accomplishing goals:\n\nIf you have access to a delegate (i.e someone you trust), don\u2019t treat them like a bureaucrat. \n\nA delegate can perform tasks you didn\u2019t know needed doing and build aligned systems beyond your design, a bureaucrat cannot.Status is a coordination mechanism\u2014the relative respect &amp; patterns of deference accorded to people, groups &amp; organizations by wider society.\n\nDispersing it wisely decreases friction for certain high impact people to team up and work on certain high impact projects (&amp; vice versa).Celebration of such people isn\u2019t merely a personal reward. \n\nIt is how we replenish this social capital, which in turn powers the social fabric that enables these people to do what they do. \n\nWithout it, you can\u2019t go to space. (e.g. Elon helping make space cool &amp; feasible)Dispersing status is one of the most important roles of the ruler\u2014\n\nThe ruler uses his prestige to regulate overall status, so that the right people &amp; the right behaviors win, solving coordination problems &amp; tragedies of the commons.\n\nGlory is a better motivator than money.intellectual dark matter: knowledge we cannot see publicly, but whose existence we can infer because our institutions would fly apart if the knowledge we see were all there was.\n\nThe danger of copying:\n\nOnce a tradition is lost, you are making photocopies of photocopies.Each subsequent copy loses information. \n\nA crucial difference between organisms &amp; organizations is that organizations do not undergo natural selection. \n\nSince the fidelity of transmitting intricate social technologies is so low, complex adaptations cannot arise.Lost knowledge: Just as physicists are only able to observe 15% of matter in existence, today we possess written fragments from only 13% of the ~2,000 known ancient Greek \n\nMuch of our foundational knowledge was built on that ~13% Imagine how much we'd have if we'd found more?Tacit knowledge is knowledge that's not transmitted in writing. \n\ne.g. a blacksmith learns to craft well-balanced swords through direct practice and correction from a master \u2014 not by reading a textbook.\n\nMy 4/1 assist to turnover ratio in pick up b-ball\u2014you can't teach that.YouTube enables the teaching of tacit knowledge at scale unlike anything before.\n\nWithout YT, much tactic knowledge turned into intellectual dark matter.\n\nYT searches in the \u201chow-to\u201d category have grown 70% year-on-year.\n\nPerhaps as influential as printing press or telegraph.Samo's YouTube content is also great: https://t.co/7JhnlXVc9h\n\nDid a couple podcasts w/ him:\n\nhttps://t.co/8VDZeY9kg3\n\nhttps://t.co/eFR7SL4Pwg",

    "full_text": "My favorite takeaways from the book \"How to Have Impossible Conversations\" \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://t.co/AHKgHR8APYBefore entering an argument, identify your priority: is it the relationship? learning? changing minds?\n\nIf the relationship, don't worry abt being right.\n\n\"You can be right or you can be married\"\n\n\"I never considered a difference of opinion as cause for withdrawing from a friend\"Make understanding your conversation partner\u2019s reasoning your (initial) goal.\n\n\"No one cares about how much you know until they know how much you care\"\n\nWhat if they suck? If Daryl Davis can have civil conversations with KKK and help them abandon it, you can understand them.Engaging in respectful dialogue doesn't mean accepting their conclusions\n\nIt means understanding not just what they believe but also why they believe it\u2014in that process, maybe they\u2019ll come to understand your reasoning, or see that their reasoning is in error, or vice versaAttempt to re-express their position so clearly that your target says, \u201cThat's right. I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that way.\"\n\nAssure common goals, values, and points of agreement.\n\nMention what you've learned from them.\n\nOnly after this should you utter a word of rebuttalMake your goals of collaboration and understanding explicit.\n\nSay, \u201cI'm really curious what you believe and how you came to believe it, it might inform my own thinking on the topic.\"\n\nLead with curiosity and ask yourself: \"Why do they believe that?\"If you think their motives are off, lead with curiosity: \"Could you tell me more about where you\u2019re coming from on that so I can understand better?\"\n\nIf you think they question your motives, say: \"I may be off here. If something is wrong with my reasoning, please let me know.\"If you try to change their mind directly w/ facts, they'll probably double down.\n\nInstead get them to explain their epistemology--how they know what they know. Ppl are far less defensive about this.\n\nEpistemologies:\n- Personal experience\n- Others believe it\n- Religion\n- EvidenceAsk \u201cWould every reasonable person draw the same conclusion?\u201d\n\nOr \u201cHow come there are so many divergent opinions? I mean, why is it that when 2 ppl look at the same evidence they come away with different conclusions? How does one figure out whose belief is true &amp; whose is false?\"Most people borrow second hand arguments from others (Unread Library Effect)\n\nHelping people understand they\u2019re relying upon borrowed knowledge leads them to introduce doubt for themselves\n\nConversely, if they have a sound epistemology they may convince you to follow their logicIntroduce scales:\n\nAsk, \u201cOn a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you X is true?\u201d\n\nIf they say 8, \"What would move you to 6? to 10?\"\n\nSay \"I'm only a 3, can you walk me through how you got to an 8?\n\nDon't try to change their mind directly. Have them evaluate their epistemologyAsk Q's like:\n\nWhat evidence would cause you to change your mind?\n\nUnder what conditions could the belief be false\n\nWhat value does believing in it provide over not believing in it?\n\nDoes believing it make someone a better person?\n\nIn 10 years will you believe this?Try to be cognizant of ways you\u2019ve adopted essentializing views and work to uproot those beliefs in yourself. \n\nFocus on contributions over blame.\n\nInstead of saying \"X caused Y\" ask, \"What role, if any, did X play?\"\n\nLearn nonviolent communication: https://t.co/01foQ2oOPlModel the conversation you wish to have\n\n- Lead w/ curiosity\n- Be humble abt your knowledge. Say \"I don't know\" &amp; rate confidence from 1-10\n- Explain your epistemology\n- Change your mind upon hearing better arguments\n- Disavow extremists from your side\n- Steelman their side\n\n/FIN",

And every time I meet a priest, he wants to talk about sex\u201d\n\nWhatever it is that you deny yourself will become your new prisonWhen getting started in your career, try to learn something that people haven\u2019t quite figured out how to teachDevelop an owner/founder mentality\n\nMost people say, \u201cI\u2019m not the founder. I\u2019m not being paid enough to care.\u201d\n\nBut you are.\u00a0The knowledge and skills you gain by developing a founder mentality set you up to be a founder down the line, and it pays you in that sense.When you\u2019re negotiating with other people, ultimately if someone else is making a decision about how to compensate you, that decision will be based on how replaceable you are\n\nIf you have high leverage, that makes you less replaceable (and you\u2019ll likely get more equity)How to get leverage (or specific knowledge that makes you indispensable?)\n\nGet it permisionlessly \u2013 learn to code, create podcasts, become a good writer\n\nThrough permission \u2013 get people to work for you, or raise capitalSpecific Knowledge Can Be Timely or Timeless\n\nTimely: Machine learning\n\nTimeless: Persuasion\n\nTimeless specific knowledge skills usually can\u2019t be taught (but sticks with you forever); timely specific knowledge skills come and go (but still have a fairly long shelf life)Companies don\u2019t know how to measure outputs, so they measure inputs instead. \n\nWork in a way that your outputs are visible and measurable. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have accountability, do something different.\n\ni.e be in a position where ppl can tell what role you had in a company\u2019s successThe entire structure of rewarding people comes from the agricultural and industrial age, where your inputs and outputs matched up very closely. \n\nThe amount of hours that you put into doing something was a good/rough proxy for what kind of output you\u2019d get.Today, things are much more non-linear (and as a result, judgment and accountability matter much more):\n\nA good investment decision can make a company millions\n\nOne useful product feature can be the difference between product-market fit and complete failureHumans have a need to be highly consistent with their past pronouncements.\n\nIf you want to\u00a0 do something \u2013 tell people about it because they\u2019ll hold you accountableGig economy:\n\nThere will come a day when you roll out of bed, you get an alert on your phone with a new gig, you sign up for it, you get paid in crypto, and you do your work in VR. \n\nYou work when you want, where you want, how you want, and with whom you want.The Q is not whether automation is going to eliminate jobs\n\nThere is no finite number of jobs\n\nNew jobs are being created, + they\u2019re usually better, more creative jobs\n\nThe Q is \u2013 how quickly will this transition happen, what jobs will be eliminated, &amp; what jobs will be created?The internet does two things simultaneously: Aggregate &amp; atomize\n\nIn other words, before the internet, industries tended to have few large players\n\nBut now, we have one internet company in charge that runs everything, and next to that company, there are millions of small playersWhat does this mean?\n\nWe may be heading toward a world in which, if you\u2019re employed, your employer is either one of these gargantuan companies that\u2019s running an entire industry, or you\u2019re self-employed. There won\u2019t be that much in between.Early employees at a startup often take on the same risk that a founder does without the compensation, control, and  visibility.\n\nThey should think like founders (or VCs!) in terms of diligencing the cos they're considering joining.On product:\n\nIf something isn\u2019t working, if the community you want isn\u2019t emerging, then you probably need to go back and remove something much more than you need to add something\n\nA lot of the great companies replace complexity with simplicity for the end-userCapitalism is innate to the human species in every exchange we have\n\nThe notion of exchange and keeping track of credits and debits \u2013 this is built into us as flexible social animals\n\nMarkets are what enable cooperation at scale, across genetic boundaries.You\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. It usually means you're replaceable.\n\nYou should own equity to gain your financial freedom.\n\nIt's hard to become truly wealthy when your inputs are closely tied to your outputs, b/c when you're sleeping, you're not earning.Get rich by giving society what it doesn\u2019t yet know how to get \u2013 at scale\n\nSociety always wants new things &amp; if you want to be wealthy, figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get, but it will want, &amp; that\u2019s natural to youThe internet connects everyone on the planet\n\nThis means that you can find an audience for your product no matter how far away they are\n\nAt the same time, so can everyone else\n\nThis is why you need to escape competition through authenticity. No one can compete w/ you on being youWhen you combine things you\u2019re not supposed to combine, ppl get interested\n\nJoe Rogan: Comedian, podcaster, &amp; UFC commentator\n\nTake the things you're natural at &amp; combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest &amp; enjoyment, end up at the top in a few things\u201cWe\u2019re coming out of a factory-based industrial world that was built in the 1800s under a one size fits all model for efficiency reasons and we\u2019re heading into a boutique artisanal world where 7 billion people will want 7 billion products\u201dWe descended from pessimists\n\nIf 2 ppl were in a forest 10,000 yrs ago, &amp; they hear a tiger \u2013 the optimist stays &amp; gets eaten, while the pessimist runs &amp; survives\n\nIt made sense to be pessimistic in the past, but it makes sense to be an optimist today. (Safer)\n\nRewire accordinglyToday, we\u2019re in situations which have capped downside &amp; unlimited upside\n\nIf you create the next FB, you can create billions. If you fail, you can often pick up right where you were\n\nThis risk equation is the opposite of what we used to have--which is our risk instinct is warpedSpecific Knowledge is knowledge that makes you irreplaceable.\n\nYou can\u2019t be trained for it, otherwise someone would learn it and replace you.\n\nTo gain specific knowledge, quadruple down on the stuff that feels like play to you but looks like work to othersBuffet once went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free so he could learn about investing\n\nGraham told him \u2013 \u201cActually you\u2019re overpriced. Free is overpriced.\u201d\n\nApprenticeships are VALUABLE \u2013 if specific knowledge can somehow be taught, this is how\u201cIf you care about ethics in wealth creation, it\u2019s better to create your wealth using code and media as leverage. Then those products are equally available to everybody as opposed to trying to create your wealth through labor or capital.\u201dFirst aim to get leverage, and once you have leverage \u2013 your judgment becomes the most important skill\n\nJudgment is the exercise of wisdom\n\nWisdom comes from experience\n\nThat experience can be accelerated through short iterationsYou should be too busy to do coffee while keeping an uncluttered calendar\n\nSpend your time doing only what YOU can uniquely do\n\nI need 4-5 hours of time by myself every day doing NOTHING. Because if I don\u2019t have that time, I won\u2019t be able to do ANYTHING.On Advice:\n\nReject most advice, but remember you have to listen to/read enough of it to know what to reject and what to accept. All of it cancels out\n\nWhen you hear a piece of advice, ask yourself:\n\u25aa\u201cIs this true?\u201d\n\u25aa\u201cIs it true in my context?\u201d\n\u25aa\u201cDo I want to apply it?\u201dIn general, avoid getting into situations where you\u2019re sacrificing today for an imagined tomorrowWhenever you\u2019re doing anything in business, if you\u2019re looking towards the long-term of getting wealthy, you should ask:\n\n\u201cIs this authentic to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it myself that I\u2019m projecting? Am I productizing it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I scaling it w/ labor or w/ capital or w/ code or w/ media?\u201dThe Biggest Illusions of Life\n\nIllusion #1: Meaning: We're all gonna die, what's the meaning?\n\nIllusion #2: Free will: \"Free Will\" is just our DNA reacting to the environment\n\nIllusion #3: Reality: It's possible we\u2019re living in a simulationInformation overload:\n\nThe brain is not designed to absorb all of the world\u2019s breaking news &amp; emergencies, injected straight into the skull with clickbait headlines. If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you have a sound mind &amp; body, it will eventually drive you insaneAll our diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity\n\nPascal has said \u2013 \u201cAll of man\u2019s problems arise because he can\u2019t sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a primate from a small planet circling a star in the Milky Way galaxy...I was fortunate enough to realize (the American Dream) by becoming a tech entrepreneur and angel investor. And like every person as they get older and wiser, I\u2019m now turning into a pseudo philosopher\"\u201cEducation should be free at this point. The idea that you need to pay $250K to sacrifice 4 years of your life so a professor can lecture you in a lecture hall is ABSURD.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the best teacher in the world will teach everyone in the world about that given topic\"The bigger problem this generation will face is adult education, not child education\n\nChildren are learning machines \u2013 they just need the tools.\n\nFor adults, all the tools are there. \n\nIt\u2019s the desire to learn that\u2019s scarceThe smaller the company you work for, the happier you\u2019ll be\n\nWhy? \u2013 Better relationships, fewer rules, and more creative freedom\n\nMore accountability (and it\u2019s more visible)\n\nYou\u2019re easily able to try multiple things to see what you\u2019re good at\n\nMore flexibility &amp; authenticity\"I don\u2019t care how rich you are. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a top Wall Street banker. If somebody has to tell you when to be at work, what to wear and how to behave, you\u2019re not a free person. You\u2019re not actually rich.\u201dI don\u2019t have a typical day nor do I want a typical day\n\nI\u2019m trying to get rid of the concept of having to be at a specific place at a specific time\n\nAll I care about is am I doing what I want to do, am I being productive, and am I happyWhat you do &amp; who you do it with is WAY more important than how hard you work\n\nWork isn\u2019t linear: 8 hours of input does not equate to the same output for every single person\n\nInstead of working 9-5 like a machine, work like a lion: Train hard, sprint, rest, &amp; reassess. Repeat.Set an aspirational hourly rate for yourself and stick to it\n\nIf I have to return something, and it costs less than my personal hourly rate, I\u2019ll throw or give it away\u201d\n\nIf you need to do a task, but can hire someone for less than your hourly rate \u2013 hire themI think everybody should have kids. You\u2019re here because an unbroken chain of your ancestors, from tadpoles all the way until now, replicated. Are you going to be the first one to miss that branch? Don\u2019t do it; your genes will hate you\u201cThe problem with UBI is that you\u2019re creating a slippery slide transfer straight into socialism\u201d\n\nThe moment people can start voting themselves money, combined with democracy, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the bottom 51% starts voting themselves everything the top 49% hasUniversal basic income doesn\u2019t solve the meaning problem\n\nPeople who are down on their luck aren\u2019t looking for handouts. They need meaning \u2013 this comes from education\n\nYou have to teach a man to fish, not throw your rotting, leftover carcasses at him saying \u2018Here, eat the scrapsINSTEAD \u2013 \n\nEstablish a set of basic substance services that people have to have and provide those in abundance to the people who need them (basic housing, basic food, basic transportation, and high-speed internet access)We\u2019re nowhere near close to General AI. It's hard to model.\n\n1 \u2013 We have no idea how the human brain works \n\n2 \u2013 We\u2019ve never even modeled a paramecium or amoeba\n\n3 \u2013 There\u2019s the assumption that all the computation is happening at the neuron level, but nature is very parsimoniousA few scenarios for how the human/AI relationship could work:\n\n1/ The benevolent dictator scenario: AI wants to help us, knows what's best\n\n2/ The \u201cEarth is just in my way\u201d scenario: self-explanatory\n\n3/ The benign neglect scenario: Treats us like a pile of ants or bacteriaThe larger the group of people you have together, the less trust there is and the more cheating takes place \u2013 the more you gear towards capitalism\n\nThe smaller the group you\u2019re in \u2013 then by all means be a socialist\n\nMany socialists only know family life, and thus over extrapolateBrief Thoughts on Social Media\n\nHumans are always signaling. Rather than really looking at yourself, you\u2019re looking at how other people look at you.\n\nEverybody is getting their 5 seconds of fame &amp; becoming a celebrity\u2026. but celebrities are the most miserable people in the worldPart of what makes entrepreneurship so stressful is you\u2019re never supposed to show weakness (whether to employees, board members, investors, etc.)\n\nBut it\u2019s the nature of the tech business that 99/100 startups effectively fail\n\nSocial media exacerbates this b/c you're \"always on\"When faced with a difficult choice, if you can\u2019t decide, the answer is no\n\nWe're biologically built to not realize how many choices there are, b/c we evolved in tribes of ~150 people, where if you pass up one choice, the second one never comes along\n\nHence why we rush the choiceYou may think: \u201cI\u2019m not happy because I\u2019m smart\u201d\n\nThis is partially true\u2014you\u2019re unhappy because you know too much, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t undo this and retain your intelligence\n\nThe more you dig into certain deep truths, the freer and more peaceful you will become.All the benefits in life come from compound interest; whether in money, relationships, love, health, or habits\n\nI only want to be around people who I know I\u2019m going to be around with for the rest of my life, and I only want to work on things that have good long term payoutNo hierarchies\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be above or below anybody\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t treat somebody like a peer, and they can\u2019t treat me like a peer, then I just don\u2019t want to interact with that human\u201dWe live in a world that is structured around the preferences of radicals who won\u2019t compromise. \n\nIt\u2019s not built around the will of the majority. \n\nThe will of the majority does apply in some cases, but in many more cases, it\u2019s the minority rule.Naval still values freedom, but his definition of it has changed\u2026\n\nWhat freedom used to mean to him \u2013 Freedom to do anything he wanted\n\nWhat freedom means to him now \u2013 Freedom from reaction, freedom from being sad/feeling angry, freedom from being forced to do things\u201cLife is a single player game. You\u2019re born alone. You\u2019ll die alone. All your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. And in three generations, you\u2019ll be gone \u2013 no one will care.

Do 20-50 meetings in 2-3 weeks all back-to-back. Be 100% focused on raising.Good ways to get investor referrals:\n\na) introductions from other founders or strong deal sources\nb) introductions from existing investors\n\nBad ways to get investor referrals:\na) introduction from investors who aren\u2019t investing \nb) cold outreachUnderstand the VC biz model:\n\n\"Out of ten swings at the bat, you get maybe seven strikeouts, two base hits, and if you are lucky, one home run. The base hits and the home runs pay for all the strikeouts.\"\"So logically their investment selection strategy requires a credible\u00a0potential\u00a0of a 10x gain within 4 to 6 years on any individual investment\u2014so that the winners will pay for the losers &amp; in the timeframe\u00a0their\u00a0LPs expect.\"\n\nIf you don't want to 10x in 4-6 yrs, don't raise VC!Parallel track angels &amp; VCs simultaneously.\n\nTell angels if you want that you can secure their allocation if they commit early (or it's more likely), \n\nAsk VCs at the end exactly how their process works.Do your research on the firms &amp; angels. See what else they've invested in.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand their fund size, deal cadence, talk to their founders, you\u2019re not taking it seriously enough.\n\nYou are one of dozens of meetings for them a week. Stand out by doing your homework.During the meeting, don't read your deck to investors. Make it a conversation.\n\nIn the beginning perhaps ask \"Have you invested in the space before?\" to gauge their knowledge.\n\nMidway through the pitch ask \"What's interesting to you about this biz? What's unclear?\"When pitching:\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to consider the biggest reasons an investor might *not* invest, and pre-emptively address those reasons.\n\nIf you\u2019ve solved for them, point to evidence.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, point to how you\u2019ll address them, and the moat you\u2019ve built to date.Ask in the beginning:\n\n\"Do you believe there will be a multi-billion dollar co in the space?\"\n\nIf no \u2014&gt; don\u2019t go further until yes\n\nIf yes \u2014&gt; here's our unfair advantage and why now (instead of 5 yrs ago or 5 yrs from now)When fundraising for a complex co, you might simplify it for investors by saying something like:\n\n\"In order to invest, you'd have to believe that we can execute on X, so that we have Y, which will lead to a multi-billion $ biz.\"\n\nFrame it simply so they can pitch their partners.A founder told me it was reasonable to him that the conversation break down in an founder-to-investor pitch would be 90% founder, 10% investor.\n\nIMO it should be closer to 50/50. The more they talk and ask Qs, the closer they are to getting to a yes.Unconfident fundraisers talk 90% of the time, hammer home hand-wavy talking points, &amp; grasp at straws for what they think VCs wanna hear.\n\nConfident fundraisers listen 50% of the time, ask questions, &amp; admit the risks to investing as well as what they have &amp; haven't proven yet.After pitching, one thing you may try \u2014 under the context of your improvement \u2014 is asking them to role play as if they were pitching your biz to their partnership.\n\nIf they don\u2019t pitch it well, that may tell you something. Conversely, you may like their phrasing better.VCs will say nice things but It's always a no until it's a yes\n\nMost likely nearly all investors will say no but you only need one or a few to say yes.\n\nYou're going to feel like a total failure at it until someone says yes and then you feel like a huge success.You have to maintain a sort of dual awareness: the confidence of someone who's going to raise easily alongside the paranoia of someone who won't (so that you'll prepare like mad)\n\nhttps://t.co/jwjrR1A5rIEvery pitch meeting in which you don't consider updating a slide in your deck is a missed opportunity to learn.\n\nhttps://t.co/7315mSEMkJOther things to think about:\n\nMoney should last to 18-24 months and enable you to reach meaningful milestones\n\nSeed rounds typically result in 15-25% dilution for founders. \n\nKnow whether existing investors are following-on, and how much of the round is already spoken for.Don't recommend setting price at the beginning.\n\n\"We want to work with the best people, so don't want price to be the reason why that wouldn't happen\"\n\n\"We're gonna let the market set the price, but it'll be something reasonable, but ultimately we want to pick the best partner.\"",

So ended up w/ higher of both\n\nInterest rates were high, we thought money was tight, &amp; we thought it wasn't monetary policy's faultBut in fact, interest rates were high because inflation was high\n\nReal problem: We were printing money at too rapid rate that was generating inflation &amp; ultimately pushing up interest rates\n\nLearning: we had to raise interest rates by more than inflation to bring inflation downLast major challenge to solve is how to keep unemployment from spiking during a recession. \n\n(see another thread soon about COVID)Was post 1929 recovery b/c of or in spite of New Deal?\n\nHard to say. Anytime you spend a ton on, say, military, you'll increase employment\n\nYou could argue National Recovery act (e.g price controls) inhibited the recovery\n\nDollar devaluation &amp; nothing else could have done the jobKeynesianism &amp; Monetarism go in and out of style:\n\nDuring high inflation, monetarist ideas get popular.\n\nDuring deflation &amp; zero interest rates, Keynesian ideas win out.\n\nIn 1920s, we were printing money but weren't having much inflation bc ppl hoarded cash so ppl left MonetarismMonetarism came back in 1960s to help keep high inflation under control. \n\nThen long era of stability under New Keynesianism (synthesis of 2), until 2008, when we went to deflationary zero interest rate environment.\n\nOld Keynesianism returns (fiscal stimulus over monetary policy)Keynesianism has survived critics:\n\nCritics said if you borrow a lot, you'd push up interest rates and crowd out private investment.\n\nBut stimulus efforts didn't result in high inflation, or some of the problems people worried about with QEAnalogy for thinking about Keynesianism v Austrian economics:\n\nConsider business cycles as Grand Canyon:\n\nKeynes approach is to fill in the canyons so that the ground is flat\n\nAustrian way: look at flat land with mountains sticking up occasionally and do the mountains as excessesKeynes: Business cycle is caused by periods of low activity, and you need to raise activity up to the strongest the economy can support. Booms are normal.\n\nAustrian: Business cycle is caused by excessive exuberance &amp; malinvestment. Booms are outliers and must be reset.Two types of left wing economics:\n\n1/ Statism &amp; Nationalization\n\n2/ Income redistribution.\n\nNordic countries have the latter not the former.\n\nVenezuela has the former not the latter.Austrians want to go back to the gold standard, but it's not feasible.\n\nA big increase in the global demand for gold can mess things up.\n\n/FIN\n\nLearned this from reading &amp; talking to Scott Sumner, Bryan Caplan and listening to EconTalk &amp; Macro Musings",

And debt continues to go up.The average student graduating from college right now who has student debt is graduating with $29,000 in debt \n\nNow keep in mind, average student $29,000 in debt, half of the population has under $2,000 in liquid assets.\n\nAnd you can't go bankrupt out of that debt.That's unsustainable in a republican democracy\n\nThat's why we have populists on both sides saying \"You're getting screwed.

It has to rely on economies of scale or adjacent markets to scaleMarketplace Eras:\n\nListing Era provided lead gen. (e.g. Craigslist, Grubhub, Yelp)\n\nTransactional marketplaces facilitated transactions on platform. (e.g. Thumbtack, Fiverr)\n\nManaged Marketplaces integrated w/ supply or owned supply outright (e.g. Honor, Clutter) https://t.co/zKAxOTer3NManaged Marketplaces:\n\nBear take: Capital intensive, lower margins, less scalable, handicap network effects b/c you commoditize supply \n\nBull take: It's a more controlled &amp; thus higher quality experience, can do lower margins if TAM is in trillions (e.g. healthcareVertical marketplaces:\n\nEnable a 10x better experience.\n\nFor example, you could buy tickets on Craigslist &amp; eBay.\n\nBut Stubhub integrated w/ ticket providers so you could also verify identity and get seating charts.\n\nSlice does this for pizza ordering.Vertical marketplaces\n\n\"1- Look at large horizontal marketplaces, identify the verticals w/ low NPS, &amp; use product to leapfrog the liquidity of the incumbent\u2019s supply base\n\n2- Nail a small, overlooked and under-appreciated niche, then land &amp; expand from there\"\n\n- @sarahtavelVertical vs Horizontal Marketplaces:\n\nIf you play this out 10 years, can you imagine people have 20 apps for different service categories on their phone? Probably not.\n\nSo vertical marketplaces either likely have to expand and become horizontal, or get acquired.Double commit marketplaces: Marketplaces that pick supply for you (e.g. Uber).\n\nIf you do enough work, it looks like the marketplace is the provider rather than the individual suppliers (e.g. Amazon).\n\nFor this to work you need to highly curate supply and  match effectively.B2B Marketplaces:\n\nWhy Now? \n\n- After 10+ yrs of consumer marketplaces, we're finally getting to b2b.\n\n- Today's business owners are more tech-savvy.\n\n- B2B requires domain experience to see the opportunity, unlike consumer\n\n- Selling to SMEs where they are fragmented.Factors of a Healthy Marketplace:\n\n- Fragmented supply\n- Not prone to monogamy (e.g babysitters)\n- User experience has to be 10x better than status quo\n- Low friction for supplier to sign up\n- High frequency &amp; high AOV\n- In the payments flow\n- Good reason to stay on platformLabor Marketplaces:\n\n- If you're successful, you lose a customer (they get a job). Thus more of a marketing play\n\n- Vertical marketplaces unbundling LinkedIn can work if they offer value beyond job (e.g RigUp creates a network of profiles for the industry, including reviews etc)Human capital marketplaces:\n\nBiggest underutilized asset of all time is people's time: https://t.co/LkmbaVK5wi\n\nP2P Marketplaces: https://t.co/iowARJuJ1S\n\nLots of data that can be leveraged for people matching (e.g what I'm reading, purchasing, etc)Building marketplaces:\n\n- Identify \"red hot center\" - the group that feels the pain most acutely b/c they'll jump through hoops to use the product initially.\n\n- Main way to create magic for demand is to have the right supply. If you have exclusive lock over supply, that's a moat.How to solve Chicken &amp; Egg problem:\n\nConstrain marketplace to a geo or category you can own\n\nNail one side of the marketplace (usually supply)\n\nBiggest way to grow supply is sales ppl.\n\nBiggest way to grow demand is word of mouth--or when supply brings demand (e.g. Eventbrite)Liquidity is what matters:\n\nCraigslist even w/ horrible experience did $1B last yr b/c of liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is basically how well that you can satisfy user demand. How well supply and demand value props match. Conversion rate is one proxy for that.Redefine the atomic unit of supply and therefore dramatically expand the addressable supply.\n\nHomeAway stayed limited to vacation home rentals until Airbnb redefined and expanded the atomic unit of supply which enabled them to own it instead of share it. \n\nhttps://t.co/ZRes9bhCkdCorrect post link here: https://t.co/1fTp9xa5Um",

Adler says choose our lives &amp; our lifestyles\"Freud\u2019s idea is that a person\u2019s psychic wounds (traumas) cause their present unhappiness. \n\nWhen you treat a person\u2019s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality &amp; sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive.But Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: \u201cNo matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.\u201d That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.\"He isn't saying that the experience of a calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong.\n\nBut he's saying we can determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences\"If I stay in my room all the time, without ever going out, I can get all of my parents\u2019 special attention focused on me. \n\nOn the other hand, if I take even one step out of the house, I\u2019ll just become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. No longer special.\"To quote Adler: \u201cThe important thing is not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.\u201d \n\nYou want to be Y or someone else because you are utterly focused on what you were born with. \n\nInstead, you\u2019ve got to focus on what you can make of your equipment.A person wants to be a novelist, but never seems to complete his work. \n\nHe wants to leave the possibility of \u201cI can do it if I try\u201d open, by not committing to anything. \n\nIf he tried and failed, he'd shut the door to that. Many things are like this: invented stories to never tryAll problems stem from interpersonal relationships; (all joys stem from interpersonal relationship.)\n\nIf you can just be by yourself, you\u2019ll even have a justification ready whenever other people snub you.\n\nThat if you didn't have your shortcomings, you too could be loved.Anger is a form of communication, and communication is possible without using anger. \n\nWe can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for anger. \n\nIf you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all on its own.Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. \n\nIt leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise me, I won\u2019t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I\u2019ll engage in inappropriate actions, too.\u201cFreedom is being disliked by other people.\u201d \n\nThe courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. \n\n(Don't be a jerk but:) \u201cYou have enemies? Good. It means you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d - Churchill\"My father was a moody person. But to blame him for why our relationship went bad is Freudian etiology.\n\nThe Adlerian teleology reverses the cause-and-effect interpretation.\n\ne.g. I brought out the memory of his badness b/c I don\u2019t want my relationship w/ my father to get better\"\"That\u2019s right. For me, it was more convenient to not repair my relationship with my father. I could use having a father like that as an excuse for why my own life wasn\u2019t going well. That for me was a virtue. And there was also the aspect of taking revenge on a feudal father.\"Should strive for, in order:\n\n1. self acceptance\n\n2. confidence in others\n\n3. contribution to others\n\n\u201cPeople are my comrades, the world is a beautiful place.\u201dOut of ten people, two will love you, one will dislike you, and seven won't pay attention to you. \n\nFocus on the two that love you, not the ones that dislike you or the seven who don't care.When one adopts the POV of Freud, one sees life as a great big story based on cause and effect. \n\nSo it's all about where and when I was born, what my childhood was like, the school I attended and the company where I got a job. \n\nThat decides who I am now and who I will become.For Adler, You're not bound by the past. Life isn't a linear narrative. \n\nLife isn't like climbing a mountain. You are not \"en route\". \n\nIt's more like a series of dots/moments. \"Here and now\"\n\nLive like you're dancing: you're enjoying the moment but also going somewhere.As long as you don\u2019t lose sight of guiding star of \u2018I contribute to others\u2019 you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like.\n\nWhether you\u2019re disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free, but don\u2019t care what people say about you\"The greatest life lie is to not live here and now.

A variable is a set of variables. When two variables are the same, they mean the same thing. They have the same underlying causes and effects.

(micro insurance? pay by day/mile?)innovative models:\n\n1/ P2P Insurance \u2014 can lower prices , cutting out middlemen\u2026sort of like p2p lending\n\n2/ Renting an existing insurance companies balance sheet by coming a MGA thus improving underwritingInsurance 1.1 improve existing workflows or create new ones \n\nInsurance - 2.0  reimagining some aspect of insurance as we know it\n\nInsurance 3.0  risk management in the age of commercial space travel, human genetic modification, and general AI.\n\n- from https://t.co/1Qq1uOB0UNI invested in Cover allows you to take photos of stuff that you want to insure &amp; then they'll help find the right coverage for you.\n\nThey're effectively a marketplace for risk working with over 30 different carrier partners &amp; also building insurance products internally.Also we invested in parametric company in Mexico.\n\nIn parametric insurance, policies do not indemnify against actual claims but rather pay out based on triggers linked to objective data points.

We belong to groups, tribes, nations, etc.Liberalism is predicated on the assumption that we have powerful abilities to reason, but we cannot reach universal agreement on the big Q's about life. We go to war over these disagreements\n\nSo, liberalism privileges individual rights as to help us collaborate when no one agreesLiberalism has evolved over time.\n\nInitially the emphasis was mainly on \"negative rights\" (free speech, due process).\n\nThen it evolved to \"positive rights\" (e.g. equality)\n\nNegative rights are positive sum, positive rights not so much.\n\nMore context: https://t.co/kig6uUPlfWTenets of nationalism:\n\n- You're born into a social group called a nation.\n- Each nation should have its own state.\n- Each state should have its own sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nNationalism is more powerful than civilizations.\n\nThere used to be broader empires, but no more.Many Americans misunderstand the pull of nationalism, and might dismiss the description of it as inherent in people. \n\nSince we're a liberal state and the liberal ideology is so deeply baked into our DNA, we gravitate to thinking about liberalism above all else.Tension between liberalism &amp; nationalism:\n\n(Progressive) Liberalism is about universalism. Everyone has the same rights. That value system is the only thing that's not diverse about liberalism's aims.\n\nNationalism is about sovereignty. This is our people, our land, our rules, etcThis leads liberalism to want to spread universally, as that is the best way to operate.\n\nThis ruffles nationalists who want sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nLiberalism praise rights and universalism above all. Nationalists praise sovereignty &amp; particularism above all.",

You're literally doing the same thing a McKinsey analyst does, for fun\n\nAnd yet your parents are angry at you. That's interestingCould you possibly bring that same nuclear energy of productivity into other realms into software in general?\n\nYou should not be stymied by your mood. software should enable you to jump &amp; punch above your weight &amp; current mood and it should use all these psychological techniquesOne of the most powerful game mechanics: Leaderboard\n\nBecause a leaderboard is merely digitizing what we do all the time. So when you sit down to at say a dinner party and you meet a bunch of new people. You're basically assessing who's good who's bad who's interesting who's notBe careful what you measure though.\n\nCrossFit, for example, optimizes like for you to do as many reps as possible.\n\nYou can always accomplish more reps by breaking form and by hurting yourself.\n\nSo people get injured as an emergent property of the systemAnother important game mechanic is injecting randomness into things. \n\nThis is why humans play the lottery over and over is because of the random nature of it. They can't model itPpl say you should be contrarian &amp; not care what others think about you. \n\nIt's not clear to me that that is true b/c what other people think about you, at least what the ppl you respect think about you, is a very important signal as to whether you're doing the right thing or notWhat the people you respect think about you is actually really important training data because that gives you a sense of where you stand in the world.\n\nAnd I'm not talking about the masses or Twitter.\n\nI'm talking about the 15 ppl that are influential to you, that you care about.Pull vs Push mode of talent sourcing:\n\nInitially it was like, let's find unrepresented talent globally and it turns out the way you find them is you by actually building a thing for them to play where the act of playing makes them better &amp; then you see who are the best players?The world where we're in today is there's a shortage of positive feedback, especially positive feedback to the right people. \n\nIt is scary to read stories of how great ppl got their break when someone gave positive feedback to another person, e.g an email from someone you admiredThe goal is to get people stuck in a positive feedback loop, rapidly iterating in the positive feedback loop, making a lot of progress and reaching a point where that positive feedback loop doesn't plateau and then hopefully repeating that process over and over again.These are fun studies where people move to different zip codes and their weight always fluctuates in the same direction. If you want to lose weight the simplest thing you can do is to move from SF to NYC. Everyone else is working out and eating healthy and you'll do the same.Willpower is overrated.\n\nYour environment is a one-time CapEx expense on your willpower. You do it once. You fly to a place, start working in a company or go to a campus or make this new friend. And then it just yields dividends.People are often interested in specifics like: what time do you wake up? What do you eat? What's your workout regimen? \n\nThat's is actually the wrong message to send bc I can tell you what time I wake up, but what's more important is the fact that I'm obsessed about optimizing itThe takeaway that I think more people should be in the business of self-experimentation is actually more important than the results because the time that I wake up is pretty individualized to me think a lot of happen to todayHow's work going? People have a cached answer to that.\n\nSo they're doing mental substitution: \"Well, how was today?\"\n\nSo if you want to get someone to quit their job find them on a bad day and ask them that Q....suddenly they start telling themselves work isn't great isn't it?Most major career decisions are made on moments of vacation b/c you come back to work and what happens is not necessarily work is good or bad but you're flooded with  work, which is not as fun as vacation. That catalyzes you to go out and look for another job.Viewing ppl as emerging properties of underlying systems:\n\nInstead of saying that person's good or bad, look what cause that person to do X or Y.\n\nThen you can decode people, predict them better, which means you can interact w/ them better &amp; create new structures to manifest thatWhat separates I think successful &amp; unsuccessful people is these Loops that they get stuck in and I think the most important interventions basically change the loop and certainly that's what we're trying to do at scale.There's a lot to be learned from that in terms of setting up a positive feedback loop for yourself. \n\nFall in love with what you do so that you get to work on what you loveBenefits to impacting people younger:\n\nI mean it seems like as you age you basically trade novelty for pattern recognition and the brain is much more plastic and malleable when you have less dated a pattern recognizer on so shaping someone's life early on in life.on CRISPR:\n\nWe don't understand the computer, so why edit the source codeStart small:\n\nThere's these amazing interviews with with Mark Zuckerberg in 2005 where he says, yeah, our goal is to really be a good director at Harvard and maybe other few universities.Why people don't talk to users:\n\nThere's a psychological software bug in your brain where it is more satisfying to build the thing than to show the thing to users.\n\nMaybe b/c it predicts there will be more flow in working on the things as opposed to showing it to ppl.the twist on this is you shouldn't do exactly what your users tell you to do but you should engage with them a lot. You want to engage with them and figure out what the underlying problem is. File it as input, but don't necessarily react to every single feature request.Advice on advice:\n\nif you want to become a good advice giver - you want to figure out who are you in life a real influencer for -- the people for whom you have write access to their brain -- such that you can give them advice literally no one else can give, and they will listen.You don't want to overly rely on metrics. e.g. Google got to the point where it was A/B Testing shades of blue. \n\nYou don't get the iPhone that way.\n\nPersonal iPhone moment: Do something that may seem crazy &amp; may not align w/ the data but has the potential of changing your lifeAvoid a sort of innovator's dilemma:\n\nIn order to reinvent yourself, you need to both cannibalize existing business models and certainly redirect resources in a way that doesn't immediately kill your core biz.\n\nGoogle model better for incremental innovation, Apple for disruptive.On having sufficient struggle:\n\nGoogle and Facebook's culture really stuck a toothpick into the sand and had a massive oil will come gushing out.\n\nHard for them to have same sense of urgency as, say, Amazon that had to struggle for a long time to succeed or Apple that almost diedPlaying the game of life in third person as opposed to first is important b/c you're going to have good &amp; bad days you're going to be sitting at some point in a 1-1 w/ someone &amp; it's going to be a bad day &amp; they're going to deliver bad news &amp; you're going to need to react wellAs a manager &amp; as a leader you want to design the best game that both aligns company incentives &amp; employees desires &amp; the real way to understand people is kind of through this deeper substrate level where you actually become a genuinely interested in them &amp; their lives &amp; storiesRead fiction while you're young:\n\nif you're a disagreeable rational person you have this mindset where you're constantly judging &amp; thinking 'well is that true' fiction right below that enters your psyche at a deeper level &amp; helps you develop more models about how the world worksIn general we walk around the world and we have a pretty strong firewall set up against things other people say or do.\n\nSome of that gets toggled off when it's someone from your own tribe.\n\nEveryone has a tree of influence and if you want to change their opinion, identify it.If you meet someone you really respect because their opinions in art and you talk to them about business that may change may surprise yourself and how much that changes your views as well.If you're firing your 4th person, it's the same as Tesla letting go 1/4 of their workforce, b/c you were relying on that person to contribute that much &amp; then you remove them from that &amp; then all of a sudden everyone else has to balance the workload &amp; cultural impacts are larger.we're trying to figure whether you can make software that can detecting great founders. \n\nBut I think the even more exciting Q is can you make software that can creating great founders b/c, especially early in life, you can radicalize them to become great if they have it in them.Paradox of conscientousness:\n\nwhat drives a lot of conscientious people is a sense that they are not good enough where they are and they need to improve.\n\nThis leads you to get better, but also leads you to sometimes question how great and big you can become in the first place.What happens is someone else challenges them to realize just how great they can become &amp; so they manage to break this vicious conscientiousness loop where you're constantly thinking to yourself 'I'm not good enough, must work harder' which prevents you from reaching for the starsHow do people make life decisions?\n\nHow do people decide when to change their job? \n\nHow do people decide political affiliation? \n\nHow do people decide who to marry?I'm in this privileged situation to have built  the right skills at the right time (writing software in SV) which is a bit like being a merchant in Venice in 1760.

Should we be doing more to cure cancer? Should we doing more to cure Alzheimer's? \n\nThe answer is yes https://t.co/u1kRbTO3H5The question isn't: do you get a pill that can make you live to 1000? That's too abstract and ideological of a way to frame it.\n\nAnswering that general Q positively makes you sound weird. \n\nBut saying no the specific Q's (cancer, dementia, arthritis) makes you sound cruel.The frontier of medicine today is different from the past, where death wasn't quite as linked w/ q's of aging, it was infant mortality, or the plague.\n\nToday the epidemics are of old age. E.g. Cancer you have 1 in 1,000 chance of getting it when you're 30, 1 in 10 when you're 80.Some people are scared about eugenics or Nazi experiments or Frankenstein experiments, but that's not happening. \n\nWe're not in the world of Los Alamos in 1945. \n\nWe're in a world of Epicurean hedonism &amp; complacency, where the dominant idea is that there's not much you can do.And our culture says you should just accept it, you should accept the stagnation of your lives, the stagnation of the West, you should accept the idea that the younger generation will do less well than their parents. And that's the light motif of our time.We talk about living forever, but the truth is, we have trouble curing toenail fungus\n\nWe have about 100 times as many scientists today as we had in 1920. And yet progress is about the same rate, probably even slower\n\nIt's not b/c low hanging fruit has been picked, it's culturalCultural problems:\n\nScientists under age 40 make most of the big discoveries and yet 2% of NIH grants go to scientists under age 40\n\nPeer review process where nothing heterodox can be funded\n\nPublish or perish dynamic, where they focus on incremental instead of fundamental.Bob Laughlin won Nobel Prize in Physics in 90s. \n\nHe then researched an area far more controversial than climate science or evolution: How much actual important work was being done by his colleagues. Not much, it turns out. He got blackballed, despite his Nobel Prize.Propaganda narrative among scientists b/c they're in in a Malthusian struggle against fellow scientists to get money from the government and the way that Malthusian struggle works is you lie and exaggerate more than your fellow scientists.Cultural stagnation:\n\nin 1960s ppl said don't do cigarettes b/c you could work harder &amp; be smarter. That's not zeitgeist of our time\n\nThe zeitgeist today is marijuana. It's opioids. It's ppl in their 20s living in their basements playing video games, amusing themselves to deathBut evolution! \n\nhow far one should apply evolutionary logic the evolutionary paradigm to to humans? \n\nIn a business context, whenever someone mentions evolution, they're about to do something extremely cruel. They're about to fire somebody for no good reason at all.There are continuities w/ humans &amp; animals, but also discontinuities.\n\nOne of the one of the great discontinuities, is that is that we are aware of our deaths.\n\nSo Darwinism isn't the way to make sense of death. Neither is Nietzche who said we need to go back to nature.\"I remember when I first experienced this as a 3 year old child sitting on this rug made of cow in my parents apartment building. What happened to the cow, the cow died. This was extremely disturbing. But I can't go back to when I was two years old. I can't become the cow.\"These other myths around death don't make sense either:\n\nNationalist myth: Meaningful to die for your country\n\nNon-Christian Religious myths: Worship the spirits of the dead\n\nLenin: You need to break some eggs to make an omelette (wut lol)\n\nMeaning isn't inherently found in deathAt the heart of the cultural malaise of the West is there's no longer teleology, nor the sense of a limitless open future of our society.\n\nthe default atheist position ends up being epicureanism. It's, you know, eat drink, be merry, for tomorrow, you may dieThere needs to be teleology. If only an atheist project, it'll collapse. \n\n\"You know, atheists are very motivated when they're young. \nI have nothing against atheists. I have nothing against old people. I don't like old atheists. They just don't work very hard anymore.\"\"Teleology is like a woman of ill repute. Nobody wants to be seen with her during the day, but many use her at night.\"Common criticisms: inequality, boredom, space for young people\n\n\"If you're talking to a five year old who says they're bored, the answer isn't, you know, hope you're gonna die soon\n\nIf you're concerned about inequality, the answer isn't, well, everybody should die so we're equal\"Conclusion: \n\nWe're not in a promethium science moment, like Los Alamos in 1945. Instead, we're in an Epicurean world of stagnation &amp; bureaucratization.\n\nThat's the cultural battle we need to fight in order to focus on longevity and, more broadly, reverse the decline of the West.",

This is not the history of science. It's just the history of the technology industry, in general. As I write this, the Apple ][ is on sale. Apple has been making products for the last 60+ years, and is one of the most profitable companies in history. It has almost no competitors, and has never been in a recession in the last 30 years, despite being in the 90's. Apple has been able to operate with such a vast amount of cash and ability to invest in all areas of innovation. This has paid off at such a level that it is easier to invest in things that are novel and/or risky. In other words, innovation is the antithesis of monopoly capitalism.

The more ppl there are, the more total opportunity there can be\n\nFilter pulls you in the direction of less. The more ppl there are, the less likely the quality of avg personFocus too much on utility (get too big), and you kill the signal.\n\nFocus too much on signal itself without bolting on utility, then it becomes like Harvard \u2014 people know it has no purpose other than the signal and that itself weakens the signal.\n\nIt becomes a bubble. \n\nExamples:TF has stronger signal than YC but not as much utility\n\nYC has weaker signal than TF but more utility\n\nHarvard is stuck in a bit of a hopeless middle: it\u2019s neither so big that there's a ton of utility nor so small that it\u2019s super curated.

Important for any good w/ high fixed cost and low marginal cost (software)\n\nSubstitute: Opportunity cost for innovating vs copying what's already worked elsewhere goes upGlobalization w/o tech breakthrough makes sense on a micro level but breaks down on macro level.\n\nIf you look at US cars per capita and extrapolate to India, that can work for India. But if you extrapolate everywhere, oil will cost $300 a barrel and we'll have a global depressionThe future effects of technology are hard to predict:\n\nWhen the transistor came out, people thought they'd be good for hearing aids.Why has science slowed?\n\nMany scientists had their breakthroughs in 20s.\n\nThe more advanced the state of the art is in any given field, the more of your time you have to spend just getting caught up\u2014&amp; thus you miss being able to contribute in what some ppl call your peak years.As population skews older, you have fewer people in the workforce and more people needing healthcare.\n\nOlder people are also more likely to vote (2 to 1), so politicians cater to their needs.US deficit in oil production was basically tying the global economy together.\n\nHad to keep Middle East stable, which meant had to keep everyone else stable too. US dependency on Middle East for oil was an implicit subsidy for the East Asian export driven economic success stories.Now that we are energy independent, doesn't make sense for us to intervene as much for oil.\n\nBut intervening might make sense to ensure the world is on our currency system, in our supply chains and in our cultural sphere.\n\nWar for oil was never popular. War for P&amp;G even less.What can we learn from east asian miracles?\n\nU.S. shouldn't copy blindly everything that they do anymore than they copied everything the U.S. did.\n\nBut they do prove state directed model can work, if competent.\n\nLesson: Make it high status to be in gov't so great ppl go there.Quoting someone else:\n\n\"There's only one thing worse than working than living under incompetent &amp; corrupt gov't. And that's living under an incompetent &amp; thoroughly honest gov't b/c at least in the 1st scenario, you can pay someone to let you do what you need to do.\"One reason why trade deficit doesn't matter as much:\n\nSince U.S. is a great place to invest in b/c of human capital, Maybe U.S. should be running a deficit because it's still the best place to put money, whether it's safe money in treasuries or risk capital in startups.China might be vulnerable:\n\nCCP derives political legitimacy from the fact that the economy is growing\n\nWhen U.S. struggles, they switch the president, but don't question democracy\n\nIf China had their own 2008, unclear it'd be the same. Propaganda campaign underway to make it soMental model of Trump:\n\nDespite many flaws, he's good at evaluating (&amp; memeifying) the weakness of others.\n\nIn real estate, he didn't buy a good area and improve it, he buys a disaster area &amp; makes sure lenders are more scared of him defaulting than he is.\n\nIt's a strategy.Charter Cities:\n\nGeography, demographics, resources, &amp; culture matter. \n\nDon't try to build these top down systems that can apply everywhere, instead adapt to local circumstances.\n\nYou can't just say if this country had U.S. institutions, it'd have U.S. GDP per capita.Charter Cities: \n\nUnlike startups, you have to worry that incumbents will literally kill you if you threaten them.\n\nYour best case scenario is the Bin Laden option where you have this extremely depressing life where you're waiting to get killed\u2014&amp; then you get killed. Be careful.Anti-tech in some sense is bi-partisan.\n\nLeft says we're concerned that people might not be getting ideas from approved sources.\n\nRight says we're don't like these techies doing drugs at Burning Man.\n\nBoth worry about 7 yr olds w/ smart phone addictions.\n\n(Caricatures of views)Response to tech-lash? \n\nCompanies get less ambitious.\n\nMicrosoft got less ambitious after anti-trust, which is partly why it missed mobile but also is least threatening of all tech giants. \n\nThe monopolies always pretend to not be monopolies.Malthus was actually correct that higher crop yields did lead to faster birth rates.\n\nWhat he didn't foresee was that the shift from manual labor to producing food led to longer career investment &amp; thus people delaying getting married until they're older (&amp; thus having less kids)Progressives &amp; Conservatives are confused.\n\nProgressives have adopted conservative puritan view that man is intrinsically sinful &amp; should subvert himself to the not sinful.\n\nConservatives have adopted progressive view that good institutions can change ppl (e.g democracy in Iraq).Progress studies itself is fundamentally agnostic. \n\nJust focused on increasing productivity, rather than asking who wins, who loses.\n\nIt's anti-partisan in the sense that partisanship tends to arise when we become less productive, that's when politics becomes more zero sum.Why we're polarized (besides slow growth)\n\nInternet means more news outlets that appeal to niche interests.\n\nSocial media means it's easy to get the propaganda you want.\n\nYou can choose media outlets that are going to outrage you in the precise way you want to be outraged.Peak California:\n\nHousing shortage means rents go up in line w/ cash comp, not equity comp, &amp; that means that incumbents have a recruiting advantage over startups.\n\nIn other words, high real estate selects against early stage companies &amp; selects for later stage companies.Stanford boiled down is an acceptance letter, a network, and a job fair at the end.\n\nYC realized you could do this in 3 months instead of 4 years\u2014and that equity was a better business model.\n\nLike Stanford, the more it succeeds, the more it becomes a monoculture.What Pinker gets wrong:\n\nThe distribution of extreme violence is such that the trailing mean is always lower than the the actual underlying mean.\n\nHe's correct about what a linear extrapolation from the historic data tells you, but wrong about the nature of that distribution.Darwinian case for monogamy:\n\nIncreases the chances that you'll be loyal to each other &amp; dedicated to their kids\u2014who are then more likely to do the same for their kids.\n\nCounter argument is that a lot of artistic and intellectual achievement doesn't come from normie familiesAustrian economics:\n\nBoom &amp; bust cycles don't just happen in gov't, but also in private business.\n\nThey tend to predict bubbles too early and that's why you'll tend to make more money betting on the bubble &amp; going along for the rideLessons from Alan Greenspan:\n\nIf you want to positively impact the world, you can either have great ideas or do whatever it takes to implement them.\n\nSomeone has to do the latter, dirty work. What's the point of having brilliant theorists whose theories never get implemented?Ideal education:\n\nKids should find a topic they're passionate about, dive into it in as much depth as possible, just nerd out to the maximum extent possible, &amp; then find something else wants once they've either reached the limit of their abilities or their interest has wanedOnline filter bubbles are bad, but real world filter bubbles can be good.\n\nThey can be safe spaces for people who have heretical ideas to mold them until they're ready to be shared.\n\nSafe spaces for people who don't want to be merely mimetic.Equality\n\nWealth gets more unequal, but consumption gets more equal (which is why the gap btw a billionaire's life and our lives is smaller than it used to be). \n\nOvertime, wealthy end up w/ larger share of country's resources, until a war or plague and that all gets wiped out.Role of gov't &amp; wall street: \n\nCoordinate behavior at scale to pursue a distant objective.\n\nThey both coordinate a lot of behavior that is optimal when it happens in parallel, but not that useful if it happens in sequence. (E.g Apollo)Bubbles happen when some people say the price is too high, others are saying no it\u2019s early ppl will make so much money (e.g internet bubble dot com optimists were actually right).\n\nBut the ones who got optimistic at the wrong time lost a lot of money.Equity bubble\u2014The future will be very different from the present &amp; you want to own equity in that future. We all try to be different\n\nCredit bubble\u2014future will look exactly like the past only more. Ppl who owe us money will continue to service the debt. We all try to be the sameNepotism is a credit market for reputation rather than cash.\n\nLike financial banks, there are social capital \"banks\" willing to lend social capital to ppl who don't need it and not willing to risk social capital on new &amp; risky people\n\nNeed to incentivize social capital investingSocial capital bubbles:\n\nIf there are just more people willing to vouch for more people, then you end up with too many bad ideas getting funded.\n\nAnd you also end up with people optimizing for getting recommended versus optimizing for building something goodSocial capital isn't like the economy where you can tinker w/ interest rates &amp; inflation.\n\nSo in that sense of status market is maybe analogous to the gold standard where there can be inflation and deflation and they're actually somewhat exoticness to the systemMy conversations w/ @ByrneHobart here:\n\nhttps://t.co/OP95Sbokvq\n\nhttps://t.co/qcDHNenO56\n\nSign up here to read more.

    "full_text": "There's a theory that asserts that the logical conclusion of social justice is cultural version of Marxism that ends up merging with its economic counterpart.\n\nhttps://t.co/1LFyeVe1qU\n\nThread unpacking this theory \ud83d\udc47Zooming out:\n\nThe introduction of capitalism was a big deal.\n\nIt reoriented who became high status (e.g. merchants) &amp; who didn't (e.g. intellectuals)\n\nThose who lost status became resentful.\n\nSocialism catered to that resentment by promising status back to the low-status.Remember: What people care most about is status: https://t.co/iqyFLnlfQt\n\nChristianity promised the meek that they'd go to heaven unlike rich people.\n\nBut socialism was promising the goods here on Earth.\n\nWhich is why it became so popular.It's also highly effective, b/c it attracts ppl who are loyal.\n\nSay what you want about how horrific communism is (&amp; it is!), but it breeds loyalty. USSR was loyal. China is loyal.\n\nRich people aren't loyal. They have too many good options.\n\nYou're only as loyal as your options.Socialism didn't work in the west, b/c ppl got too rich.\n\nMore specifically, ppl believed in The American Dream, that they too could get rich if they worked hard &amp; had talent.\n\nFrom a Status calculus POV, it made more sense to believe in capitalism than socialism.\n\nBut today?This is why economic growth is so important.\n\nWhen we're not growing, the world becomes zero-sum. \n\nThere's a winner for every loser, &amp; ppl focus on capturing their piece of the pie instead of collectively expanding it.\n\nLow growth presents ripe conditions for Marxism.\n\nLike now?Remember, politics is similar to economics. It's about capturing as much power as possible\n\nIn economics, you do that by giving customers what they want\n\nIn politics, you do that by giving voters what you want\n\nWhat do lower status ppl want? Higher status\n\nhttps://t.co/hGCtVeTt4aWhich is why Marxism is a highly effective strategy, especially when people aren't getting rich.\n\nElections are won by majorities. \n\nWhat politicians do is say to lower status people: vote for us, and we'll give you high status. \n\nDon't vote for us, and you'll remain low status.They don't even have to deliver on their promises.\n\nThey're inherently against the establishment, they can just keep blaming the establishment for the lack of change\n\nBeing unreasonable gets you more loyal followers than being reasonable, b/c reasonable people have more options.So what's Cultural Marxism?\n\nEconomic Marxism didn't work b/c social class isn't a strong enough identifier. Once you get rich, you stop being loyal. And ppl wanna be rich\n\nAlso, capitalism provided a counter vision\n\nSo overtime, ppl saw how rich the west was getting &amp; lost faithWhat's a better identifier? Well, identity. What you can't change: Gender, race, etc.\n\nThose are identifiers on which people will always be loyal.\n\nAnd so there's a huge opportunity to capture votes by appealing to those axes.\n\nEven when they get wealthy, they'll always be loyal.What they did was stick to the structure: promise high status to lower status people. \n\nBut they changed the content, adapted to the new era\n\nNow people weren't poor b/c class warfare, it was because of oppression\n\nIt spread wildly. Its foil is capitalism: https://t.co/xluhnAtug6Communism lost partly b/c there was an attractive alternative in the west.\n\nAt some point Soviet communism became lower status than American capitalism.\n\nCultural Marxism has no such alternative to point to, so it's hard to switch.\n\nIt's is the highest status system in the world.Central to this theory is the belief that humans are wired to seek status\n\nAny good political agent will organize these ppl on the basis of increasing their status, the way any commercial agent will find a way to make money.\n\nEquality is an amazing path to power for a politician:If you\u2019re below average, \u201cequality\u201d sounds like \u201cboost in status\u201d, so inherently 1/2 population is always down\n\n&amp; the only way to enact this is to increase state power, which is why it's so politically appealing\n\nEasy way to get voters, &amp; easy way to justify expanding state powerCultural Marxism is less formalized than Economic Marxism was, partially because it can't be so explicit otherwise it'd be discredited.\n\nBut also because a distributed version (e.g. press, universities) is more effective. No central choke point. \n\nHow so?https://t.co/FeQhh7IhnSThis is why they are so anti-capitalist.\n\nIt gives people more options to get status, namely making money.\n\nWhen you make money, you don't care as much (e.g. China)\n\nMaking money makes people less dependent on them and thus less loyal.If it\u2019s easy to earn status through money, you\u2019ll get a house (or start angel investing)\n\nIf there\u2019s no way you\u2019re making any money, you need another path. Which path?\n\nWell you can always virtue signal\n\nThis is why they attack The American Dream: it's a threat to their powerHow else has it become so powerful?\n\nWithout religion, we take moral cues from our political tribes: https://t.co/PFvHp3Hgbv\n\nSay what you want about socialism, but it is a collective morality\n\nFreedom isn't a morality, or at least a collective one\n\nThis is why libertarians loseWait: How does Social Justice lead to Economic Marxism?\n\nZooming out: What's the end state where social justice would say, \"we accomplished our goal?\"\n\nAbsolute equality of outcome.\n\n(Logically, there is no equal opportunity without equality of outcome)\n\nhttps://t.co/MxZwxFBPyyThey deny it of course b/c it (communism) is politically unfeasible\n\nTo be fair, they genuinely don't believe they are advocating for it.\n\nIn practice it's: \"I would never advocate for Marxism, I just advocate for all of the policies that would create and enforce Marxism.\"Meaning: when the goal is economic \"fairness\", there's no morally acceptable line until you get to total equality of outcome\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say \"OK, we have economic fariness now\"\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say: \"OK, the government is sufficiently powerful\"\n\nIt's always more.There's no in-between.\n\nYou're either a total egalitarian or you're not. If you are, you sign up for the whole package.\n\nIf you haven't yet, that's just temporary. \n\nThere's no stable middle ground.\n\nOtherwise your position is philosophically incoherent &amp; you will have no allies.Christopher Caldwell's book talks about how civil rights was explicitly sold on the basis of equality of opportunity for one specific group, but immediately morphed into equality of outcome for every group, &amp; created legal precedent to enact it.\n\nhttps://t.co/mobzRlEC3wSocial justice aims to end all types of discrimination. \n\nInitially that was legal discrimination but over time the scope expanded.\n\nEquality (equal treatment) turned into equity (equal outcome).\n\nThat switch is how Cultural Marxism turns Economic. \n\nIt's a powerful wedge.",

Customers aren't quite getting value, users are not growing quite that fast, word of mouth is not spreading, press who use it are a kind of blah, and the sales cycle takes too damn long.\"Andreessen continued:\n\nBut you can always feel it when product market fit is happening.

Opposite for under.\n\nIf you have 40%, invest in growth.Survey: \n\n1/ What is it that ppl love about X?\n\n2/ What holds ppl back from falling in love w/ X?\n\nIf they love product for same reason, just find more of that user.\n\nSpend 1/2 time doubling down on what users already love about X &amp; other 1/2 on what\u2019s holding others backIf you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score won\u2019t increase. \n\nIf you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you. \n\nThis insight can guide your product planning process, effectively writing your roadmap for you.Roadmap:\n\nTo stack-rank priorities, use a simple cost-impact analysis: label each potential project as low/medium/high cost, and similarly low/medium/high impact.\n\nImpact from solving held ppl back is clear from survey.\n\nImpact from doubling down on strengths is more intuitiveHighest Expectation Customer (HEC):\n\nPpl who enjoy your product for its greatest benefit\n\nNo massive consumer internet brand has ever grown primarily through viral loops or viral mechanics\n\nThey also always have virality through word of mouth\n\nWhich is why HEC's are so important.Recap: \n\n1/ How would you feel if you couldn't use X?

Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles of company buildingThere is a narrative that founders have to either be college friends or worked together before\n\nI think this is less true than we think\n\nFounders of Coinbase initially met on Reddit I believe?\n\nFounders of Stemcentrx met on Craigslist!\n\nYou might be too afraid to fire your friendBack when, ppl were embarrassed to say they met their spouse via apps, &amp; instead prefer \"at a bar\".\n\nToday, a curated app sounds more thoughtful than the randomness of a bar.\n\nSo with co-founders too: We'll laugh at how we preferred the randomness of school to an app or program.Just like many marriages end up in divorce, and so it\u2019s worth rethinking the dating/matching process\u2014\n\nOne of biggest killer of startups is founder breakups, and so it\u2019s worth re-considering co-founder matching.If you don\u2019t already have a cofounder in your network, how do you \u201cdate\u201d?\n\nBuild top of funnel by:\n\n- Telling the world what you\u2019re thinking (e.g. writing a post, hosting a meetup, etc)\n- Join On Deck (https://t.co/dw9qXrOjiF)\n- Build an audience:What to look for in a co-founder?\n\n- Complimentary skills (how do you, together, have an unfair advantage?)\n- Value-mission alignment (what success looks like, etc)\n- Company alignment (who makes decisions, what tradeoffs you will/won\u2019t accept)You\u2019ve found the person, but you don\u2019t want to shot-gun--then what?\n\n- Go on a road trip or other intense experience (e.g. live together)\n- Do a hackathon (or work together in trying conditions)\n- Meet the spouse and/or parents if you can (seriously!)Non-obvious Q\u2019s to ask:\n\nIn what ways are you crazy? What are your failure modes?\n\nWhat was it like working with ex co-founders?\n\nIf this didn't work out, why not?\n\nWhat's most important to you ($? Managing People? Fame?)\n\nWho should be CEO? Who has the vision?When picking co-founders, it's important to know:\n\n\"Are you the co-founder who has clarity around the vision or are you the co-founder that's gonna build it?\"\n\nFailure mode: Both think they're in charge of vision, &amp; then they constantly butt heads over what direction to go in.Another common co-founder failure mode: Different goals.\n\nOne co-founder wants to make $50m from their startup in 5 yrs, and another wants to never sell.\n\nSometimes you can reconcile different goals, you just have to ensure they're not incompatible w/ each other long-termTalk early and often about:\n\n- What success looks like (outcomes, culture, roles)\n- Non-negotiables\n- Who\u2019s in charge in case of disagreement\n\nOn this last point: Make sure there is a clear CEO / tie-breaker\n\nWork together under stress early so you can simulate hard times.Early on also figure out:\n\n- Personal runway &amp; how much salary they'd need\n- Other extenuating life circumstances \n- 5-20 yr vision for their lives\n- How each wants to scale w/ the company\n- Equity split (prob 50/50)You don\u2019t need to be best friends. (Or even friends at all.)\n\nYou need to respect &amp; trust each other, communicate effectively, and work well together in accomplishing company goals. \n\nAnd not hate going to work every day.Cofounder relationships are like marriages, and should be treated as such\u2014something work on consistently.\n\n- Read relationships/communication books (e.g NVC)\n- Both see a coach\n- Date first. \"Try before you buy\"\n\nBut just like marriage, if it's too much work might not be a fit.What kills startups is never finding Product Market Fit &amp; co-founder issues.\n\nMinimize co-founder issues so you can maximize time spent on finding PMF.\n\nPlus, most co-founder issues stem from not enough PMF to begin with.\n\nSome stem from too much, but those are the good kind. :)Treat co-founder search like any other recruiting process:\n\nhttps://t.co/dCz3y47WX3",

Schramm's law: \"The single most important contributor to a nation\u2019s economic growth is the number of start-ups that grow to a billion dollars in revenue within 20 yrs.\u201dWe produce ~33 unicorns a yr. \n\nWe need ~100 unicorns a year to maintain post WWII growth rates.\n\nHow can we get more founders? De-risk it.\n\nMake median founder outcome closer to avg &amp; by removing economic friction. Remove other bottlenecks (thread)\n\nhttps://t.co/K9naMtc8QWIndeed: There are lots of VCs who could make great founders, who would actually prefer to build a business than do a financial services job, but they just prefer the economic calculus of venture capital. \n\nOthers, to be sure, are unwilling or incapable.\n\nhttps://t.co/KJXWgohcaAWe also should decrease cultural friction to starting companies:\n\n- celebrate starting cos as a thing for ambitious ppl to do globally\n\n- see startup failures on resumes as badges of honor instead of blemishes\n\n- create communities to find co-founders &amp; founder support(@beondeck)Other things holding founders back.\n\nStartup formation tropes are too romantic. e.g:\n\n- had an idea they were passionate about or were perfect customer for\n- knew co-founder since college\n- wanted to be founder, didn't \"stumble\"\n- founder was all-in.\n\nhttps://t.co/rurn6eT13iBut the real reason not to listen to VC advice b/c VCs don\u2019t listen to their own advice\n\nhttps://t.co/gqP55x8LzKIrony: Although VCs believe in markets, in some ways VCs are Central Planners\u2014a few partners deciding all investments (&amp; prices), across all sectors, geographies, &amp; people\u2014even tho they can't have perfect information on all.\n\nVenture Capital? More like Venture Soviet Russia. ;)Just as one person could have understood all of physics at one point, it was possible for one person to specialize at \u201cinternet investing\u201d and be an expert at all. \n\nThis is why we at @villageglobal (&amp; others) are trying to decentralize venture:\n\nhttps://t.co/E3ZOiUA7mfStartup investing\u2019s weird bc it takes 10+ yrs to be great\u2014not bc of skills gained but bc of feedback loops\n\nYou could invest for 3 yrs, be a beginner, go in a coma for 7 yrs, come back &amp; be known as an \"expert\", despite same level of skill\n\nIn which other field could this happen?Another VC/bball analogy:\n\nIn bball you can discover Giannis when he\u2019s 15 &amp; he can dominate day 1\n\nThe VC Giannis has to wait yrs for their dominance to be recognized\n\nThis suggests there\u2019s extra arbitrage in finding the VC Giannis\u2014the ppl who are already great but not legibly soPoker is a misleading analogy for VC, b/c it implies an equally distributed deck.\n\nA great firm gets pocket aces every time, a bad firm never sees an ace.\n\nWhat's hard isn't knowing how to play pocket aces, it\u2019s building the machine that repeatably gets pocket aces to begin with.In other words, ppl think VC is about sourcing, picking, &amp; supporting cos.\n\nInvesting isn\u2019t totally a craft (bc of long feedback loops), but it also isn\u2019t (all) abt luck, either. \n\nIMO it's about having a structural advantage:\n\nhttps://t.co/zgAy11P6lIVC is neither chess nor poker. It's more like war.\n\nIt\u2019s basically your ability to rig the game\u2014to build a machine that enables you to see &amp; get into the best deals.\n\nThat machine could be a reputation, a network, a platform \u2014but it has to be differentiated from other machines.More and more of seed investing is adding so much value to founders *before* they raise so that when they do, they feel compelled to make room for you.\n\nhttps://t.co/afJXAiJ3BLVC firms don't have many proprietary assets\n\nYou could steal Benchmark's playbook + it wouldn't change much, similar to how copying Lebron's regimen wouldn't let you compete\n\nPartially bc \ud83d\udc47, + also long feedback loops means VC brands are self-reinforcing\n\nhttps://t.co/utGJwQ5asmException: YC. \n\nThey changed the game by showing that VC could:\n\n- Scale founder support through...other founders (network effects)\n- Have portfolio diversity &amp; ownership &amp; keep quality high, debunked \u201cspray and pray\u201d\n- Be a franchise in Warren Buffet sense\n- Pricing powerDebunked following absolutisms:\n\n- VC has anti-network effects\n- Wide portfolios compromise quality &amp; support\n- VC is not a startup, product, or platform\n- There are no moats besides brand\n- VC has to be an artisan craft\n\nOf course, these are often true, but not alwaysVC narratives:\n\nVCs have magic so they can pick winners. \n\n*\"The Midas List\"*\n\nThey also have this magic where they can \u201cmake\u201d winners with their help and advice.  \n\nOnly they have the magic so they can only make a few investments so there\u2019s enough of the magic to go aroundIf as a VC you wanted to sound the most indispensable:\n\n- Startups are really hard to pick\n- VCs can uniquely help make companies great\n- Only ppl w/ VC experience can be good VCs\n\nYou\u2019d pick a GP-centric concentrated strategy!\n\nWider portfolio implies picking &amp; helping humility.In reality, diversified portfolios can make sense too.\n\nWhy? VC is a hits-driven business. The top 2.5% of vc-backed companies\u2014100/4,000\u2014make up all the returns.\n\nGetting into one of those w/ meaningful ownership is everything.\n\nAvg unicorn rate is 2.5%.\n\nhttps://t.co/yWJIONIJn3Your fund size is your strategy. \n\nYour best co will return 1/2 of all profit. And then the 2nd best might return a 1/4 &amp; the next best might return an 1/8 &amp; so on\n\nFor $100m fund, you need 1 co to return $150M, so that's 10% at 1.5B or 1% at 15B.\n\nNeed (meaningful) shots on goalIf you consider founders more helpful than investors, and investors not that a helpful, then what\u2019s actually most founder friendly is having a big portfolio\n\nWhich is why founders love YC\n\nAfter one institutional VC, there\u2019s serious diminishing returns.Follow-ons make sense most when they are doubling down or not at all.\n\nWhy? They are competing with every other opportunity out there, and artificially limiting to your own pool makes most sense when you have conviction.\n\nhttps://t.co/QZ33X4j00oFounders don't want to raise money from institutions as much anymore. \n\nThey want to raise money from individuals.\n\nHow VC got unbundled: https://t.co/716W2MjBYIVCs have to signal that\n\n- they have conviction in individual cos, but their incentive is to run a portfolio &amp; hedge their bets \n\n- they can uniquely help founders, but their incentive is to spend time finding new cos\n\n- they are builders too, but they're financiers 1stOne bearish take on VC value add is that, because capital is such a commodity, what's surprisingly helpful to founders &amp; angels when looking to fill out rounds is VC firms that decide quickly &amp; transparently.To be sure, VCs used to be able to add a lot of value. \n\n15 years ago, the VC who sat on 10 boards had genuinely novel info to share with a founder \n\nE.g. PM-fit, hiring, sales, fund-raising...\n\nNow 99% of startup questions are available via blogs &amp; online content.Getting a job in venture capital is partly less about \u201cwho you know\u201d and more about \u201cwho you\u2019ve helped.\u201d \n\nStart creating a personal portfolio of projects that allow you to help others, especially around getting into deals, and you may break into VC\n\nAlso: https://t.co/ncANag5MB1If you are looking to join a VC firm, the question the firm needs to be able to answer is:\n\n\u201cIs this person going to help me to invest in companies that I otherwise would not have invested in without him/her?\u201d\n\nHow do you do this?\n\nhttps://t.co/iLr4RPOtPwIf you\u2019re a up-and-coming VC trying to build a name for yourself I think there\u2019s a big opportunity in niche podcasting.\n\nMake the go-to-podcast for healthcare, VR, DTC\u2014pick any topic.\n\nIt\u2019ll build your network in that space &amp; you\u2019ll be the first person people think of for deals.Some smart person looking to break into venture should create a Stratechery for early stage VC.\n\nTake the fundraising announcements and explain &amp; analyze the broader trends behind them.\n\nOther ideas on breaking into VC: https://t.co/iLr4RPOtPwAirbnb Dropbox Coinbase etc\n \nIn ~every YC co, other VCs put in over 10x more $ +time.\n \nAnd yet, in founder interviews, YC gets comparable love.\n \nThat's the power of putting people in business, &amp; believing in people when others don't.\n\nBe first check in!VC is very reflexive: Perception becomes reality because of long feedback loops. Get #s on the board early then if you know you want to do it long-term.\n\nhttps://t.co/QYpGXYIHyCLPs don't want VCs to have big diversified portfolios b/c LPs  are already sufficiently diversified\n\nVCs don't want founders to diversify b/c VCs are already sufficiently diversified\n\nIt's Go All In or Go Home all the way down\n\nhttps://t.co/LWVlWakiFpHow does COVID-19 affect LP/VC market for new funds?\n\nSome thoughts paraphrased from a conversation with an older VC who's been through a couple cycles. Down pointing backhand index\n\n(Curious for alternative perspectives.)\n\nhttps://t.co/LrDwC2Ko9VHow do we fund science and longer-term projects?\n\nhttps://t.co/NHVOgDIWSUPre-seed is about proving customer value, not revenue.\n\nConsider a restaurant: The KPI to track is not whether customers ate &amp; paid, it\u2019s whether they finished their plates, took some food home, and came back again.\n\n(more wisdom from @AliBHamed)Series A is b2b, Seed is b2c.\n\nAt Series A, your customers are the founder + other seed firms\n\nAt Seed, your customer is the founder. You need to be top of mind b4 they start co. Wide net\n\nExplains why seed firms spend more time on Twitter &amp; later stage spend more time networkingOn VC/founder relationship being a marriage:\n\nMaybe a more precise analogy is a divorced couple w/ a kid. \n\nThere\u2019s some alignment, some misalignment\u2014sometimes they want you there, sometimes they don\u2019t\u2014\n\nSometimes you flourish as co-parents, sometimes they kick you out &amp; sue you.Future of VC:\n\nVC funds technical risk. \n\nInstead of MBAs running spreadsheets trying to figure out CAC to LTV, they\u2019re funding companies that are trying to cure cancer, develop flying cars, extend life, get us to the moon\u2026\"I would hope that people go back and look at 2018 and 2019 and say I can\u2019t believe that founders sold 50-80% of their companies before IPOs to pay for Facebook and Google ads. You\u2019re basically selling 50-80% of your company to Facebook and Google.\" - Andrew D'Souza\"VC branded itself well, right? You have these smart people who put together these fancy websites and basically said that if you raise from XYZ firm, you\u2019re going to be successful. But it was this false promise. It\u2019s caused cos to take capital they wouldn't otherwise - Ali HamedBeing a VC used to be about technical risk, then it evolved and became also about market risk. \n\nHow to evaluate markets?\n\nPeter Thiel vs Keith Rabois approach to markets\n\nhttps://t.co/VhERuXhCX1in 2005, PG discovered an arbitrage opportunity by identifying that young technical founders were being overlooked\n\nin 2019, with the rise of no-code &amp; the intense focus on technical founders, perhaps the pendulum has swung + a new arbitrage opp is biz &amp; product minded foundersDomain expertise is more important now\n\nSoftware's eaten low hanging fruit &amp; now going for more\n\nFor areas within logistics, healthcare, finance\u2014expertise &amp; relationships matter\n\nWe used to think only founders can learn domain expertise\n\nBut experts can also learn to be foundersMaybe this is why recently it seems VC partners have more leverage over their firms than they did before\n\nIf vesting worked differently, we'd likely see VC look more like NBA free agency--more switching. Maybe that changes overtime.\n\nhttps://t.co/9tL9PAp8NkThe venture firm that most captured where tech startup ethos was going in 2014-2017 was a16z imo.\n\nIn 2020 and beyond, esp if Warren wins, I think that leader may be Founders Fund (w a16z leading here too)\n\nThe difference between peace time and war time ethosIn the last decade, angel investing became a status symbol (in contrast to stodgy VC)\n\nIn the next decade, being a talent discoverer&amp;curator will become a status symbol (in contrast to transactional recruiter)\n\nISAs enable this: investments become person specific, not co specific",

    "full_text": "Just a random handful of takeaways &amp; quotes from Balaji Srinivasan's interviews. Ongoing thread \ud83d\udc47The whole concept of a real name is a social construct, imposed externally to track ppl\n\nIt used to be that you used whatever name you wanted in whatever village you were going &amp; you could always reboot\n\nIn some cultures, knowing real name of something was to have power over itSatoshi was the first pseudonymous billionaire &amp; won't be the last.\n\nWhat Satoshi did by using a pseudonym is he made sure that everyone focused on the technology and the ideas he put out there, not on his celebrity, basically eliminating ad hominem attacks against him,If your bank account is your store wealth, your real name is your stored reputation. \n\nWhat digital currency will unlock is the ability to have intermediates. \n\nYou don't need to wager your entire bank account or your entire real name on something anymore.Prediction markets will help keep media accountable:\n\nCurrently, there's a strong disincentive for speaking the truth if it makes your in-group look worse or your out-group look better.\n\nFinancial incentives help counteract those tribal incentives.We are a nation of immigrants, but also emigrants.\n\nSince Mobile makes us more mobile, &amp; law is a function of latitude &amp; longitude, it's cheaper to change the law under which you live\n\nThe way to do that used to be by voting, but exit is becoming easier, which also empowers voiceVoice really matters when people are leaving in droves.  \n\nW/o exit it\u2019s mostly symbolic. Or it becomes revolution.\n\nSovereign Individual enables libertarian founder to rebuild the state.Parable of seen &amp; unseen: Takes more empathy &amp; imagination to think about the value that isn't created as a result of regulation, relative to value the regulation saves\n\n(e.g self-driving cars prevent countless  deaths, but might introduce a few new ones. Easy calculus. And yet.)W/o risk-taking, you keep the few that might die from it, but you don\u2019t get the cure that will save the masses\n\nThe promise of charter cities to create spaces for this asymmetric risk-taking. \n\nThis in a nutshell is why we need parallel institutions across the boardAdvice on metrics: \n\nWhen you pick a North Star metric, make sure to include a second measure of quality to compensate for possible gaming of the first metric.\n\nE.g. if you incentivize salespeople on revenue, also pick a metric related to, say, customer feedback or churnBus #: how many ppl can get hit by a bus &amp; startup continu\n\nOnce bus # is more than 1 for every position, you have to view ppl as replaceable.\n\nThat's a critical transition that happens in companies where they evolve from a collection of individuals to a multi celled organism.What happens in Sovereign Individual world:\n\nGood things \u2014 Society based on choice &amp; consent. Citizen becomes customer. \n\nBad things \u2014 criminals gain new technology too. \n\nPunchline: More upside &amp; more downside. But net positive, and increased global equality of opportunity.Can\u2019t you seize BTC? You have to:\n\n1- identify person\n\n2- find a way to take private key from person \n\nit shifts the logic of violence, where it used to be that if you had the biggest military, you could take the most money, But not as easy anymore. \n\nhttps://t.co/GahhwvSM8kBest movements combine best of the right (substance) &amp; left (optics)\n\nHierarchy, capitalism, meritocracy, profit *and* egalitarianism, mission-driven, community ethos, &amp; storytelling.Crypto enables new economic opportunities: \n\nMore information asymmetry means more liquidity which means you can rent out your time.\n\nAny down time you could convert into money just based on how hard you're willing to work\n\nPress button, get work.The communist manifesto asked \"wouldn't it be great if you could be a hunter in the morning, and a tailor at night, &amp; switch through many different professions?\" \n\nWhat if you could actually do that in such a way that didn't involve killing millions of people, like communism did?Voice &amp; Exit illuminated:\n\nVoice is voting, Exit is immigration \n\nVoice is making a bug report, Exit is forking \n\nVoice is trying to do turnaround of a company, Exit is leaving to start your ownVR will be to crypto what the iPhone was to the internet. \n\nThe internet was going but post 2008 w/ iPhone apps where people can program for, internet exploded\n\neverything became more useful when you could do it in a mobile form factor (email, twitter, google maps)When have your virtual reality and virtual currency. What you get is a virtual economy, right? \n\nAnd now, via telepresence  you can now have somebody be a migrant worker without actually having to leave their family,\n\nImmigration policy is now your firewallBullish on perfumes and food because we are conditioned to sight and sound and some extent touch via haptics but scent will be harder to replicate.Is VR implausible?\n\nConsider Twitter in 2007, ppl tweeting abt breakfast.\n\nThe idea that ppl would get fired over tweets, that significant fraction of news would be wrappers over tweets, that politics would shift from offline to this online war zone\u2014that too seemed implausible.Internet increases variance in everything: You'll get more upside &amp; more downside\n\ne.g. We used to have 30-minute sitcom, we now have 10 second GIFS &amp; 10-hour Netflix binges. 10 min wrap up podcasts and 3 hr long interview shows.Twitter is a library combined w/ civil war. \n\nYou're here studying &amp; ppl are just shooting at each other &amp; sometimes you'll tweet something meant for other learners &amp; a war zone participant will catch wind &amp; shoot at you &amp; try to pull you into the ongoing worldwide social war.Tiebout sorting - model for how to solve free rider problem in politics where folks can move btw jurisdictions to the one that suits their preference\n\nTreats ballot not as something to be aggregated alone, but as a search query\n\nThis is happening online already w/ social neworkse.g here is preferred tax rate, abortion policy, etc &amp; rather than aggregate with ppl local to you, you treat it as a search query where you can find ppl who share values. \n\nFinding ideological patriots in the cloud &amp; then migrating to live w/ them will be story of 21st centurySocial Network Supply Chain\u2014visualize yourself &amp; then visualize all the nodes around you\u2014co-workers, investors, friends\u2014&amp; look at these folks and ask which of them would go south in the event of a negative news article coming from this or that political directionAn additional model of diversity: 1,000 different micro cities that are pure examples of different ways of living.Cloud formations taking physical shape:\n\n2 ppl meeting for a day\u2014ppl meet on LinkedIn &amp; get coffee\n\n2 ppl for a yr\u2014EHarmony\n\n100K ppl for a day\u2014Protest\n\n100K ppl for a week\u2014Burning Man.\n\nNo upper limit to scale &amp; duration. 100K ppl can live together for yrs = cloud cities.Another example of best of left &amp; right: Singapore healthcare is both far to the left and far to the right of the American system\n\nLeft = compulsory savings account\n\nRight = once that money is there in HSA, it\u2019s free market capitalism from there on (insurance, reimbursement, etc)Why are the free speech people sometimes reprehensible? \n\nCriminalize freedom of speech, and, among the people who will pursue, many will be criminals.\n\nNot a reflection of the merits of freedom of speech, even though restrictions on them will paint it in a poor light.The meta thing is to hold as a highest value is choice/exit\n\nThat is to say, if you choose to be in a society that has a centralized government and that works for you, wonderful \n\nif you choose to be in a basically a commune, and people could actually make that work, wonderful.To be sure, the right to emigrate at all times doesn't necessarily mean the right to immigrate at all times \n\nHarvard doesn't have open borders. Neither does the New York Times. You can't just go and walk in and get a job or admission there.Glen Weyl's view: Exit is never meaningful without other people. If exit is done collectively, voice is involved in organizing that collective exit.Crowd choice: \n\n\"If we all move there, your tax rate is currently 10%? Can you knock it down to 9.5?\" And we'll all move there. They'll . calculate it and say, okay, I can discount it and we'll lose $ here, but we'll make it up on volume, boom, it's win win\"Imagine a world where they've invented the ability to  have  flying cars that are very fast so that you can very quickly move across physical jurisdictions. \n\nAt that point, it starts becoming just meaningless to have geographically bounded nation states.What would end up happening is that people would subscribe to different nation states services, which then would negotiate with each other the terms on which their members will interact with each other, and people would be a member of one or more anyways.To reiterate: \n\nmobile is making this more mobile, and law is a function of latitude and longitude. \n\nSo if it's cheaper to change your x&amp;y location, it's cheaper it also change the law under which you live \n\nTwo ways to opt out of current location: VR &amp; physically moving.In the long term, nation states eventually become commoditized providers of land (e.g uranium) and rule sets (laws), and you can kind of pick among them.\n\nthen finally, the true borders of a community are no longer the geographical borders, but the ideological borders.Critiques of libertarianism:\n\n1- Non-aggression principle: if somebody first strikes you and knocks off your head, then you can even retaliate. So if you're just premised on retaliation, you're not going to spread. Communists were definitely willing to first strike and so onCritiques of libertarianism:\n\n2- \"Live &amp; let live\" is not a winning ideology. Galt's Gulch is a retreat\n\nAs opposed to a tactical placing your foot back to then drive forward w more energy\n\nE.g. we'll move to America, build up there &amp; then come back into Europe like 100yrs later\"I'm convinced by public choice theory--I don't think that many of these regulations are today at least optimized for the consumer I think they're optimized for optics, a person ascending some higher regulatory position\n\nI think very few of them are actually consumer protecting\"Re: drug policy\n\nNetherlands model: drugs are basically legalized.\n\nSingapore model: execute drug smugglers.  \n\nThose are extreme left or right--what US does is take the worst kind the left and the right (e.g. healthcare)Technocracy is inevitable: \n\nif I install software, I know on some level a software engineer wrote this, but think much more implicit is that in yours and everybody's head, some political engineer, some meme-genius, installed memes in our head we can' even trace the origin of.Ideal property law changes: allow for diff kinds of system administrators to experiment w/ diff kinds of property law. \n\ne.g. Twitter 2.0 w/ marketplace for usernames. \n\ne.g. The earlier you sign up for FB, more $ you get. \n\nLots of things that work in practice, but not in theoryDifferent things you need to optimize in society: \n\nThe first is the path of the citizen: vote w their ballot, vote w their wallet, vote w their feet. I think that's important that we have all three options or they can choose among their leaders.2nd: You need paths for ambitious young people to become leaders. \n\nwhat's great about the whole startup world is it takes these ambitious young megalomaniacs and it puts them into something where their their actions are actually mostly pro social.For example, there is a prominent tech founder who was a huge email spammer in college and has now become a tech billionaire. \n\nThe criminal breaks rules in order to destroy an entrepreneur breaks rules in order to build\n\nSocieties need paths to become a citizen &amp; a leaderPeople want good regulation:\n\nYou don't want to test everything yourself. you want to do  diligence on a regulator &amp; then just kind of trust after that point.\n\nWhat regulators deliver as a product is basically a form of star ratings, and some form of bands of bad actors.The most valuable companies in the last 20 years have actually all been cloud rather than land regulators.\n\nGoogle regulates the web, filters out malware\n\neBay regulator of their own marketplace, filtering out bad actors.\n\nUber &amp; Airbnb have star ratingsRidesharing is interesting b/c it's a hybrid of the regulator &amp; the marketplace\n\nmultiple different legal regimes that exist at the same x comma y location at the same latitude and longitude.\n\non your phone, you can opt into different taxi regulatory regimes w the tap of buttonRe: responding to market failure, it's actually good to tolerate a bit of anarchy.\n\nby tolerating a period of anarchy, you usually develop a technological solution that's superior to imposing a misaligned third party. \n\nEmail spam works this way.Monopolies have civilizational diabetes: too much abundance takes away drive\u2014can't get to infinity unless you know what 0 is\n\nShirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in 3 generations: 1st becomes wealthy, 2nd inherits some work ethic, &amp; 3rd becomes spoiled kids who've never known hardshipMonopolies generate tons of money\n\nAnd that money attracts parasites, folks who, in a weird, rational kind of way, want maximum compensation for minimum effort, and that huge amount of wealth now starts getting eaten from within by termites\n\nAnd so disruption takes care of itselfThere's a lot of tech companies are just going to get killed by crypto over the next 20 years. \n\nThere's so many different areas that crypto gives you tools to attack: Encryption. Property Rights. Governance. Balance.The most important data structure in SV is the cap table\n\nA few hundred strangers on a cap table can build Google\n\nCrypto can increase the scale of those cap tables by 1,000x. \n\nFrom aligning a few hundred ppl to millions of people. \n\nWhat could that enable? Sovereign CollectivesSovereign Collectives: \n\n20,000 Amazon engineers worth was enough to bring NYC to the bargaining table. NY is 27 million person state. Why did they care about 20,000 people?\n\nProbably made economic sense. Shows that small amounts of coordinated ppl can influence law.tech ethos (win &amp; help win) is neither progressive nor conservative /libertarian. \n\nprogressives would would deny win-win, see world as zero-sum.\n\nconservatives/libertarians are not as ambitious or collective (prefer live and let live)Progressives are generally against inequality and concentration of wealth and corporate power. \n\nAnd libertarians/conservatives are often against centralization, and concentration of state power.\n\nCrypto aims to decentralize both.In economics there's this concept called the solo convergence theorem: all economies converge as a model. \n\nI'm not sure that's real in economics, but I know it's real on Twitter: all ideologies converge the same ideology (the sick burn, the dunk, \"let me get this straight\")B/c Twitter turns us into monsters.\n\nWhat's funny is even if you actively try to not do this, the 1% of the time you do it will be the tweet that seen by, like 80% of people, right?\n\nAnd what happens is, people even if they don't realize it, subconsciously respond to incentives.Satoshi should not actually be analogized to a religious leader, like Jesus, but instead somebody like Newton or Einstein. \n\nThey're someone who's worthy of respect, but also can be wrong, and should be!\n\nNewton probably would have been tickled that Einstein corrected his theory.Consider a policeman or teacher having their savings go to a pension fund, who then puts it into a VC, which then goes &amp; puts it into a startup.\n\nW/ crypto, that teacher, if they choose, can go straight to the startup. They can still go the old route, but now they have a choice.Folks are primed for egalitarianism when they are being selected (\"equality!\"), and they're primed for elitism when they are doing the selecting\n\nWhen selecting, they don\u2019t just want a average school for their kid, they want the best school. Not a random doctor, the best doctor.So when you turn everybody into investors, you make everyone a selector. That's a massive shift.\n\nThey're thinking about wealth &amp; value creation, which involves downside as well as upside.\n\nThey appreciate that $ doesn't grow on trees, &amp; it's hard to make(w/o printing or taxing).",

    "full_text": "How does COVID-19 affect LP/VC market for new funds?\n\nSome thoughts paraphrased from a conversation with an older VC who's been through a couple cycles. \ud83d\udc47\n\n(Curious for alternative perspectives.)Zooming out:\n\nLPs used to do 60% public stocks, 40% liquid bonds.\n\nThe next evolution was going heavy into illiquid alternative assets (PE, VC, and natural resources)\n\nYou could arbitrage your long time horizon as an institution to garner outsized gains by embracing illiquiditySo they allocated meaningful chunks of portfolio to PE broadly.\n\nMaybe 3/4 buyout funds, 1/4 VC. All illiquid.\n\nOver last decade, all of these have performed well for the most part, which has grown their PE allocations perhaps double where they want to be.Also, there's been a huge expansion in people starting VC/PE funds, raising more money &amp; on quicker time scales.\n\nMore funds getting bigger raising faster.\n\nThe top players in the asset class has been performing, so they've gotten away with it, even though LPs were over-allocatedSo, imagine in a recession where stock market drops significantly.\n\nLiquid part of the portfolio shrinks.\n\nIlliquid part of the portfolio rises accordingly.\n\nThe illiquid part was too big to begin with!\n\nAnd since liquid part down, that means PE valuations drop too.So the illiquid part isn't going to have the returns they\u00a0thought.\n\nBut the marks on illiquid assets arrive a lot later than public stock\u00a0prices.\n\nSo now they're significantly more allocated to the alternative assets portion of their portfolio (PE/VC)\n\nWhat do they do?Rebalance their portfolios.\n\nSo it looks like less PE/VC as a result.\n\nAnd these are the endowments, the professional LPs.\n\nWhat about the new LPs, who bought in at the top into new funds with no track records?\n\nYep.

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways from interviews &amp; conversations w/ Robert Cottrell of The Browser (https://t.co/EclU9j0Co2) on journalism &amp; publishing:\n\n\"Everything should last an hour, whether it's a film or a play or a dinner party. And the ideal length for a novel is 194 pages.\"Publishing industry made following errors:\n\n1/ Ad-based business model\n\n2/ Quantity over quality \n\nSimply transposing current model to subscription won't work en masse b/c people don't want 30 subscriptions.\n\nThe only solution is unbundling individual pieces from the magazine.Just like music has unbundled \"the single\", publishing too should unbundle \"the article\".\n\nPublishers are hesitant about this b/c then the stars will have more leverage over them. \n\nRight now the stars stay b/c they think they need the publishers.But soon it'll become apparent who's carrying the weight, and who's just dead weight. \n\nReaders want this\u2014they want to bond w/ writers more so than publishers.\n\nTechnology will enable individual writers to have the tools &amp; back-office only previously accessible to publicationsA top journalist at a publication creates more value than they capture, &amp; so they'll break off\n\nMany publications will suffer &amp; even disappear b/c they aren't bringing enough value relative to the value they capture, &amp; some of that value will become value will become commoditizedIn conclusion: In the future, readers will be able to directly pay writers for their work without any middleman.\n\nAlready seeing this happen with Substack\n\nThis will enable writers to charge a lot more for individual pieces.Quality writing is the most under-valued and under-priced form of creative work today\n\nThe best journalists earn $5-10 per word, or a few thousand dollars for a week\u2019s worth of work, which is quite low when you compare it to the pay of top creatives in the music &amp; art industriesOnly $5?\n\nFor writing that could teach you something useful about life, even make you a better person?\n\nWe don't even want to pay more for a piece than we pay for the coffee we drink while reading it.There might be 10,000 writers in the world who can command a following of between 10,000 &amp; 100,000 people of whom a significant number would be happy to pay one to $5 per piece.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that, in the future, there\u2019ll be a one-person media company worth $1 billion+You have to differentiate btw 2 kinds of writing: one which is being weaponized to trick people into clicking on pre roll ads. And the other which conforms to the traditional definition of writing worth reading\u2014&amp; paying for. Clickbait should be free\u2014they should pay you to read itOn reading: If a piece doesn't start well, then the chances are vanishingly small that it'll improve later\n\nSo, if you're faced with a really bad first paragraph, give it up. It's not worth your time to go deeper into it\n\nAlso only read things that'll be relevant years from nowOther reading tips:\n\n- When viewing a publication, it\u2019s important to examine their business model (be careful of websites that make money by keeping you addicted to their site)\n\n- If a book can be summarized, it shouldn\u2019t be a book.Global publications will gain more readers as translation technology advances.\u00a0\n\nEventually, translation tech will reach a point where people will be able to read an article and not tell which language it was originally written\u00a0in.\n\nWe'll have airpods translating instantaneously.Audiobook sales will overtake ebooks\n\nOne thing facilitating this: The massive popularization of wireless Bluetooth headphones\n\nWith audiobooks, authors are able to convey more emotion, include bonus content, &amp; add background music, all of which can\u2019t be done through static textLong audio: When we get really good machine summarization, then the most efficient imaginable use of your time for consume consuming information is to have summaries delivered to you as audio while you're doing something else.Kindle wasn't super disruptive\u2014about as much as paperback books, but not movable type.\n\nOur basic idea of what a book is our basic idea of who writes a book, what you get from a book, what the economic model of a book is, those things have remained intactCheck out &amp; subscribe to The Browser (https://t.co/UAHdBziII2)\u2014writing worth reading.

It's subscale. We don't think of the country as a whole, we think of just subgroups within the country, and I think there's something insane, self-contradictory about identity politicsIdentity means what makes you unique. Here it means what makes you the same. \n\nUntil the left is able to move beyond identity politics, it's not going to be able to focus on the scale that we need to be focusing on for this country.Critique of right:\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is religious in its way of resisting inquiry and distracting us from our problems. Too much scale.\n\nIt leads us to being exceptionally unaware, overweight, inefficient. \n\nThe solution to exceptionalism is to settle for greatness.The left is focused on unjustified nature of violence, the  right is focused on the amount of violence  needed for society \n\nThe nation state contains violence in both sense of the word \"contain\" -- it limits the channels but it's also part of its very being.I'm skeptical of copying things. \n\nTo the extent you're trying to copy Silicon Valley, you're ready putting yourself in some in a weird derivative position.

But that's what it was.Media continued:\n\nThis intolerance has taken on some bizarre forms. One magazine praised me as a gay innovator only to later say  I'm not a gay man b/c I don't agree with their politics.

Locks ppl into jobs &amp; taxes employment\n\nWrote this on opportunities in digital health: https://t.co/hpjDUeg3N7Why do employers pay for healthcare?\n\nRelic of WWII, where there was a wage freeze b/c of labor shortage.\n\nSo to attract labor, they started competing on benefits.\n\nFurther separates consumer from the cost of healthcare. Prevents some employees from leaving &amp; starting businesses.Small change that could be meaningful: \n\nMake any healthcare expense tax deductible or tax everything such that if consumers decide to go walk up to a hospital &amp; buy their own health care, then they can do that with the same tax equivalency as if they got it from their employersU.S healthcare quality is good, but bad at distributing &amp; financing it\n\nWHO ranking: If everybody gets A or B or C level care in country X, vs. another country where everybody gets C level care, country X w/ As, Bs, &amp; Cs gets worse ranking than the country that got everybody a CDifferent kinds of approaches:\n\nSingapore:\n\n- Only spend 4% of GDP on healthcare (In contrast to our 20%)\n\n- Only 30% gov't funded (in contrast to over 80% for us)\n\nHow? Combining best of private &amp; public.\n\nhttps://t.co/OQEwSoiC7TDifferent kinds of approaches to give everyone covered:\n\n- You can do government direct provision, the NHS model. \n\n- You can do single-payer, the Canadian model. \n\n- You can do regulation and cross subsidies, the Swiss or German models. \n\nThey can all workWe pick &amp; choose different models.\n\nFor under 65, we're Germany\n\nFor over 65, we're national insurance.\n\nFor military, we're Britain\n\nFor millions uninsured, we're Cambodia.\n\nAll the other countries have settled on one model for everybody b/c of expedience. Not us.U.S. Healthcare is worst of all worlds:\n\nPrices aren\u2019t set by the market, but they also aren\u2019t set by the government. \n\nWe simultaneously miss out on the efficiency of a purely private system and on the savings of a purely public one.Some elements of healthcare have free markets and work well. \n\nSee: LASIK surgery.\n\nSince it's not covered by most insurance plans, ppl have to compare different services, their satisfaction records, and their prices. In short, they shop around. Good ones succeed &amp; bad ones die.In healthcare, consumers directly pay for less than 15%  of it.\n\nThe government (via taxes) &amp; health insurers pay for the rest.\n\nMany of these procedures are optional\n\nIf \"Blue Shield\" was \"Blue Eats\" &amp; you could eat as much as you want after $300, maybe ppl would eat a lot more.Myths of other models\n\n- It's all socialized\n- Ration care w/ waiting list &amp; limited choice\n- bloated bureaucracy \n- insurance companies have to be cruel\n- won't work in U.S.\n- it has to be all gov't or all private o workEffects of Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n\n- Improved consumer protections\n- Limited deductibles\n- Dropped uninsured rate from 18% to 10%\n- Established baseline for essential health benefits\n\nBut also:\n\n- Didn't effect cost or move to \"pay for value\"\n- Compromised on many core aspectsBooks I read &amp; recommend:\n\n- Chronic Care\n- The Healing of America\n- Myth or Magic: Singapore\n- Where Does it Hurt?As always, LMK if feedback or additional context.

Aren't there too many founders?\n\nNo IMO. More good founders likely means more overall innovation \n\nhttps://t.co/70EmGXNRIwWe need more investors too while we're at it.\n\nWhy? Aren't there too many investors? isn't there too much capital? \n\nNo IMO. Maybe it hurts the average investor, or has some negative side effects, but it also leads to more founders which is net positive: https://t.co/70EmGXNRIwWhy would founder schools work when they didn't before?\n\nWell, YC worked. It was a specific type of education for a specific type of founder.\n\nNow that it's easier for non-technical founders to build products, more people can more easily be founders.\n\nhttps://t.co/RlF47Jc5sGWait: Isn't it a bad idea to match co-founders? Shouldn't they be people they've known since college or worked with before?\n\nThat would be great, but that constrains the pool significantly, and many co-founder teams don't fit that bill.\n\nhttps://t.co/lMrDXc9woQWait: Isn't it a bad idea for founders to soberly evaluate startup ideas, as opposed to seized in the middle of the night by a eureka moment?\n\nIt's great when solving their own problem and/or they've been thinking about it for years, but doesn't have to.\n\nhttps://t.co/rurn6eT13iWait: Isn't it adverse selection for any founder to go through such a program? Aren't the best founders total rebels? Can entrepreneurship even be learned anyway? \n\nThere might be some truth there, but they prove too much in their conclusion.\n\nMore here: https://t.co/yF3NMO2TO4Wait: if people need to be encouraged to go to a founder school to be a founder, do we really want them anyway? \n\nShouldn't founders just be the \"true believers\"?\n\nNot if you believe startups are good for the world, then you want more.\n\nMilitary does OK: https://t.co/za3sOcyM5bNote: One bad rap schools (deservingly) get is they become gatekeepers in order to entrench their importance\n\nI'm not talking about building a licensing institution. No founder should be looked down upon for not going through such a program.\n\nBut the ones who want should get it.Another bad rap is they become excuses to actually build.\n\nThere's no substitute for actual founding\n\nIf such a program prevents people from building, or makes them feel they need the program as permission, it's a failure.\n\nSuccess is correlated w/ spurring new companies.VCs have been skeptical for the above reasons, but also b/c they want to be the educators. The more capable founders are, the less they'll need VCs\n\nBut they'll always need $, so they should view it as a complement\n\nStartup education has been democratized\n\nhttps://t.co/716W2MjBYIWould love to a focus on removing other bottlenecks preventing people from starting companies, structural ones that have nothing to do with ideas, co-founders, or motivations.\n\nhttps://t.co/EiaTTUWNhU@beondeck (among others) is building a founder school for ppl who want to be founders in the future\n\nExcited to see more pop up: the skills gained by such a program (&amp; more so by actually founding) are helpful no matter what you do\n\nhttps://t.co/qU60xv8Qbi\nhttps://t.co/sVMgdeeg1qOne major goal of any founder school is to help turn founding a company from an opaque job to a clear job:\n\nhttps://t.co/rL5MG37bih",

You can only be for or against.Bad ideas are worse than bad people.\n\nNot that many bad people walking around, but lots of people get infected w/ bad ideas\n\nThey think they're doing good, or it might even be locally good, but globally bad, or it doesn't survive scaling.Why Pinker's optimism is premature:\n\nWe have a system in which more &amp; more of the kinetic energy (war) has been turned into potential energy (unused nuclear weapons). So if we don't take into account potential energy for destruction, then everything's getting better &amp; better.You talk about your taxpayer dollars supporting my physics habit, but what about my physics dollars supporting your lavish lifestyles?\n\nPhysics dollars led to development of semiconductor that won WWII, created the internet out of CERN. Do we get a licensing fee?Critique of Ayn Rand: \n\nShe was not sufficiently aware of the problems of multi level selection. Sometimes we act an individual level, but we can also act family level, group, level, national level.\n\nBut also her heroes were excellent, and I'm for genius instead of excellence.Excellence is consensus, quality control, 10,000 hrs\n\nExcellence is hill climbing, Genius is valley crossing\n\nWe want excellence in surgeons, Genius in inventors\n\nGenius is doing things that make almost no sense to others, &amp; can only be shown to have been sensible after the factSociety is run by power laws. \n\nThe thick tales of these distributions suggest that life isn't normally distributed, but distributed by power laws. \n\nAnd we need a special special class of people to play those tales to get us the returns to power us forward and advanced society.And so what I'm really interested in is not being blinded by excellence, to the prospects for other modalities in particular genius.\n\nSo you need the place for high agency people to go to high agency things with other high agency people in a very lightly regulated environment.\"To misbehave even. Like we're really going to regulate the hell out of Elon Musk, the one person who's working on the atomic layer. It's like, fine, maybe he's having too much fun w/ dating &amp; drugs, let him have fun w/ dating &amp; drugs.

It's knowing when we're being manipulated\n\nBe mindful of Russell Conjugation: I am steadfast, you are stubborn, he is a pig headed fool\n\nThe meaning is the same but the emotive shadings to the listener are different. Watch for thatOn education:\n\nThe sooner you get to the point where you're not being spoon fed something where the subject has been rearranged to make it maximally time expensive so that the teachers have jobs\n\nAlmost every subject can be rearranged so that it can be learned incredibly rapidly.Consider piano versus guitar: \"Piano, you learn all these scales, two styles, blah, blah, blah, nearly everybody learns to hate on the other hand guitar, like, very quickly, somebody shows you 3-4 chords, and you can play 95% of all the songs that ever meant something to you.\"\"I'm terrified that what's happened is that we've all fallen under a spell of magical thinking that it doesn't matter how bad things get it somehow the world is bizarrely stable &amp; safe and it absolutely isn't and I think maybe we need to actually activate the amygdala (continued)and remind everybody with what is hanging in the balance and how unstable this is so we can get on to the to the business of making a really beautiful planet for generations to come....\n\nThere's there's a sense that people are in a video game mode.\"\"Russian tradition on your wedding day, where you visit a memorial of those who gave their lives.

But it turns them evil.\n\n(e.g. Fascists used communist tactics against the communists.)So why does Left keep winning?\n\nDominion: The Left is just an extension of Christianity without Christ\n\nUniversalism is the idea that there are universal human rights and that all people are created equal\n\nThe translation of catholicism is \"universalism\"\n\nhttps://t.co/e373Efk4HwWhy else do they win?\n\n- We evolved in egalitarian forager groups, so egalitarianism naturally resonates w people\n\n- Promising people higher status is a brilliant strategy: https://t.co/tfYf9JwYtn\n\n- The Left is better at organizing (compared to, say libertarians) &amp; wants it moreScarface: \u201cFirst you get the money, then you get the power...\u201d\n\nThe left goes straight to power, using the state as the mechanism to achieve its goals.\n\nWhich is why they keep trying to load up the state with power even when the state is run by someone they hate, like right now.It\u2019s also why they dislike capitalism\n\nCapitalism and wealth creation is power outside the state\n\nAnything that promotes agency, individual responsibility, free speech\u2014these are all against the state expanding power, so they don't like it\n\nThe more dependent folks are, the betterOf course, there are benefits of egalitarianism up to a point.\n\nWhere's that line?\nWhere's the in-between?\nWho are the moderates?\n\nToo much egalitarianism and you destroy excellence. Vice versa.\n\nThe middle has been totally hallowed out. No stopping point: https://t.co/XE01fi5CL5The main reason the middle is weak is because \"activists for the middle\" is basically an oxymoron: people with tons of political energy are naturally drawn to extremes\n\nAdd to that our clickbait corporate media landscape and social media thought police dynamic, &amp; that explains itB/c of Ricky Gervais or Dave Chapelle, people think wokeness is fading out, but it's mainstreaming into our institutions (e.g. universities, media, HR departments) and our laws, and it'll take decades to reverse once we decide we decide we want to. \n\nhttps://t.co/ofuqMFsrr9To be sure, the right is unhinged as well, although in a different way: The right focuses on the past, the left is on the future.\n\nRight is substance, left is optics. Too much lack of optics is also a lack of substance.\n\nIdeally you'd have a mix of both.\n\nhttps://t.co/dCbXLav7FbA TLDR for why the left tends to win:\n\nPeople with a chance at gaining status are usually going to outcompete people who are just trying to keep what they have.

I would never send people to jail for doing drugs.\"I'm worried that we're slipping into a new consensus, where the professional class is so oriented toward the left that they're emphasizing the public goods component of those arguments &amp; deemphasizing the importance of entrepreneurship &amp; private innovation, but you need both.\"How to boost economic growth rate in US?\n\n- Commit to free trade\n- Support more scientific research\n- Deregulate housing\n- Deregulate all economic activity (except finance /environment)Why is religion is positive force for economic growth?\n\nWe're wired to think about the short-term. Religions, among other things, encourage people to have more kids and more generally be more long-term oriented. Like the Mormons.\n\nTyler's a pro-religious non-believer himself.US Healthcare doesn't even make you healthier\n\nIf you look at data, knee operations, back operations, etc They seem to have zero marginal product\n\nWe spend too much on the health care of older people and not enough on younger people\n\nIt takes too long to get a new drug approved.What would need to be true for you to believe that we're no longer in the great stagnation? \n\n\"So if driverless cars are truly up and running for fifty percent of the American population and you don't have to sit at the wheel that day. I will say the great stagnation is over.\"Advice on advice:\n\nWhen you give advice you've got to realize they're probably not going to listen. You're a placebo\n\nMeans you should think abt advice from a meta angle: i.e. should you encourage them to follow their instinct or not? If not, what need of theirs can you appeal to\"I think in a relationship you should neither be a maximizer nor a satisficer. If you're a maximizer the other person thinks you're taking advantage of them. If you're a satisficer, they'll think you're taking them for granted. Your focus should be to grow with that person.\"Litmus tests for friendship: \n\nDo I enjoy spending time w/ that person? is there mutual loyalty, common interests? are we evolving together?\n\nParadoxically, approaching friendship in a casual way can lead to real depth, whereas being too deliberate can lead to it seeming forced.Immigration:\n\nWe should have open borders w/ any country that has a more generous welfare state than we do, b/c then those people will not be coming for welfare, they'll be coming to work.\n\nWe've done a good job assimilating immigrants, better than anyone else, &amp; should do more.\"Erik let me redefine your (NBA-obsessed) childhood for you.\n\nYou spent your childhood obsessing over evaluating talent, &amp; strategy, &amp; NBA was the vessel you chose.\n\nAnd now as a VC you evaluate talent &amp; strategy. Maybe your early yrs were perfect prep\u2014can I talk you into that?\"\"If Tyrone came back, he'd write some pessimistic book. Like what if I wrote the best Marxist book?

    "full_text": "People usually defend free speech by making the legal or moral case for it, but I want to make the utilitarian case for free speech (and \"the marketplace of ideas\" more broadly)\u2014and describe how these concepts have helped enable the moral progress we celebrate today.\n\nThread \ud83d\udc47People want to limit free speech in the name of \u201cholding ppl accountable\u201d for unacceptable speech.\n\nThey don\u2019t want hurtful views to perpetuate, especially if they've caused harm in the past.\n\nThis may be well intentioned, but I worry it misunderstands how moral progress happens.If you think about the moral progress we made in the last 100 years, there was a time when that exact progress was deemed \"harmful\"\u2014when it was a view people would get \"canceled\" for, in the name of \u201cholding them accountable\u201d\n\nThose \"harmful\" ideas entered the marketplace &amp; wonIf you prevent ideas from entering the marketplace, you'll miss out on moral progress\n\nWe must assume that anything in charge of \u201cholding people accountable\u201d is likely wrong about something (otherwise there'd be no more moral progress) &amp; should be appropriately humble as a resultOf course, most unpopular ideas are not breakthroughs, they're dumb.\n\nBut 1 in 100 or a million make up for all the dumb ideas. \n\nThe idea for example, that monarchy is not the proper form of government was deeply offensive at the time. So was evolution, the world is round, etcAn open conversation allows millions of minds to go to work on these offensive ideas &amp; find the few gold nuggets, the needles in the haystack and throw the rest away.\n\nBut even for the dumb ideas\u2014the best way to eliminate them is to bring them to light so they can be fought.B/c suppression doesn\u2019t change minds\n\nYou may suppress for a while, but you won\u2019t change minds (they may double down actually), &amp; once they have power, they may silence you.\n\nYou should only create a system that you\u2019d be OK w/ in the hands of your enemy, because 1 day it will be.When you curtail free speech, what happens is that you weaken the quest for knowledge and moral improvement, and knowledge and moral improvement is ultimately the solution to eliminating hate\n\nHate comes out of fear and out of ignorance. And you fight that with knowledge.There is a long history behind censoring &amp; punishing ppl for what they say &amp; it's not good: Think China, Russia, Germany at their worst moments\n\nInstead of saying that curtailing free speech doesn't cause much harm, make the case for how censorship has led to \nmore moral progressFree speech doesn't mean \"freedom of consequences\"\n\nBut we should not let their \"consequences\" also prevent moral progress\n\nIf we want moral progress, we must respond to arguments w/ counter arguments, not bullets (economic), b/c those same bullets can be used at us &amp; our speechLet's give one example of the marketplace of ideas in action: Gay rights\n\nRemember, most people in America once believed homosexuality was a mental illness, &amp; that pro-gay speech was bigoted. They wanted to prevent these ideas from entering the marketplace.\"Hold them accountable\"Jonathan Rauch believes the US has done a better job w/ gay rights than Europe because in the US we could\nidentify the hate, confront the fears underlying it, and contrasting the truth against it&amp;discredit hate in ppl minds\u2014That's what we did.\n\n\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant\u201dConsider this story to illustrate the point:\n\nIn 1957 a man named Frank Kameny is fired from his government job as an astronomer, and he's fired because he's gay. No other reason, but because he's gay.\n\nSo remember gay people in this time were treated very poorly:They were arrested in their own homes for making love to each other (&amp; got criminal records), they'd get openly beaten on the streets, and if they called the police, the police would often join in the fun, arrest the gay person instead of the person who committed the crime.Back to Frank Kameny. He never served as an astronomer again. That was expected\n\nBut what was unexpected was that he did not back down.\n\nHe believed that the Declaration of Independence was a personal promise that the founders had made to him and he decided to ensure his promiseSo he began an opposition movement. He appealed his firing to the US government. He failed. He appealed it to the Supreme Court. He failed. He appealed to Congress. He failed &amp; received letters saying \u201cof all the letters I've ever received, yours is the most disgusting\u201dFrank says, I went to Europe to fight tyranny overseas, only to come home and discover that I must now fight the tyranny in the US.\n\nSo he then begins representing other gay people who've been fired from their jobs because he's determined. He will win in the marketplace of ideas.In 1965 Frank and some other people led the first peaceful, openly gay protest with a protest march in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nin 1970, Frank's the first openly gay person to run for Congress. He loses, but he keeps pushing for the cause. He knows he's right.He challenges the psychiatric diagnosis of homosexuality as a disease. He does all this stuff for years, and no one ever listens\n\nUntil they do start listening! In the 70s, people begin to notice what he &amp; other gay activists are saying\n\nHis ideas start winning in the marketplaceAs society held its prejudice to critical scrutiny, over enough time the prejudice lost its appeal. It just didn't make sense. As soon as it did, the dominoes of hate started to fall, and within a generation people can't believe we ever had a problem w/ gay marriage.So Frank Kameny died in 2011 at age 86. \n\nHe lived long enough not only to see same sex marriage be legal in multiple states, and to see sodomy laws overturn, and to see gay people serving in US government in secure positions and to see gay people serve in the military\u2014\n\nIn 2009\u2014He lived long enough to receive a formal apology from the US gov't from the very agency that fired him\n\nHe received their Roosevelt prize for public service\u2014their highest prize\n\nAnd best of all, the director of the agency that had fired him that was now apologizing was openly gaySo this is the power of free speech and the marketplace of ideas.\n\nFrank didn't have money. He didn't have anything but the power of his ideas &amp; a marketplace to compete in. \n\nAnd that is the thing we must protect if we want to sustainably change minds and enable moral progress./FIN\n\nFor those who want to go deeper, I recommend reading:  @jon_rauch's book \"Kindly Inquisitors\".

Gotta be something else.Two kinds of checks on population growth, positive &amp; negative.\n\nPositive checks are things that kill people (e.g. war, famine, disease)\n\nNegative checks are things that slow birth rate (e.g. when people get poorer, they tend to marry less and have less kids)Interestingly, once there are downswings in population, it takes a bit before they rise again\n\nThere's another process involved that leads to extended downswings: Elite Overproduction\n\nBacking up: When there are too many people, food is scarce, but jobs too, causing wages to fallA fall in wages are bad for workers, but good for elites: they can hire more workers for the same amount of $.\n\nWhen elites are better off, they are likely to marry earlier &amp; have bigger families\n\nSo when ordinary people are struggling due to overpopulation, the elite is booming.So the amount of elites take up a bigger fraction of overall population.\n\nThe problem w/ this expansion of the elite is that society only has room for a certain amount.\n\nAs the elite expands, there's growing pressure to find roles for them, so that they can keep their lifestyles.The state steps in to provide the excess elite with positions appropriate for their status.\n\nAnd that of course costs money because they need salaries sufficient to support elite lifestyles.\n\nA huge increase in # of elites means huge increase in govt expenses to fill these roles.As the elite continues to expand and the state struggles to find roles for them all, you get an intense competition for these positions.\n\nMany elites lose out on $ &amp; status they expected to get, making them very angry and leading them to turn on each other in intra-elite conflictA visible sign of this is an emphasis on credentialing.\n\nIn the old days when most of the elite youth could expect to inherit their parents wealth &amp; status, they didn't bother to go to university. \n\nBut w/ over-expansion, they now fight for credentials to separate them.Overpopulation isn't the only way we get an expansion of elite.\n\nThe American Dream is another way, the idea that anyone can earn their way to the elite.\n\nGlobalization amplifies this significantly.\n\nThe internet even more so. Now the whole world is competing to be an elite.Revolutions don't occur b/c masses are poor &amp; angry.\n\nThe elite control the army, so they can keep down the masses.\n\nRevolutions occur when there's intra elite competition.\n\nLeading to a counter elite, who, feeling entitled to $ they won't get, want to ensure others won't either.If you want to explain when social breakdowns occur, you need to look at 3 things (Political Stress Index):\n\n1- Mass mobilization potential (food shortages and falling wages)\n\n2- Elite mobilization potential (over-expansion and competition for status) \n\n3-  State fiscal distressMore on state fiscal distress: \n\nAs state needs to spend more on elite, it has a hard time raising taxes b/c poor are also needy.\n\nIt can't afford to keep the elite happy and alleviate hunger and suppress unrest, and these problems of funding the state contribute to its collapse.To summarize:\n\nPopulation expands until it reaches the Malthusian limit.\n\nThis means wages fall &amp; labor is cheap, which leads to high mass mobilization potential.\n\nOverpopulation also leads to elite over-expansion and thus intra-elite competition.This leads to increased state expenditure to take care of elites, which means they need to raise taxes at the same time that the masses are poorer and *they* also need more govt services\n\nIt ends in breakdown &amp; population collapse, taking you back to underpopulation &amp; small elitePeter Turchin has also written a book applying the theory to the United States. American Civil War fits this theory\n\nStructural Demographic Theory used to take 2 centuries, but now takes 150 years, which means U.S. is getting pretty close to political breakdown &amp; social calamity.This analysis may seem strange.\n\nIsn't it a problem that rich people (&amp; everyone) are having too *few* kids? \n\nThe bigger problem is that productivity growth isn't rising enough to support their growth relative to overall population growth.Humans landed on the moon 50 yrs ago. But spaceflight remains a marginal activity with just a few astronauts in space at a time. \n\nCompare that w/ how in 50 yrs you went from the first powered aircraft to a global airline industry, already carrying 10s of millions of ppl a year.If we had continued to develop spaceflight and lunar exploration, that would have created lots of jobs, as well as opened up new resources, including abundant solar energy and metals and other valuable materials on the moon. And that would have absorbed the increase in populationSignals of elite overexpansion: University attendance.\n\nIn UK since 1990, population increased by 15%, but the # of students increased by almost 100%.\n\nin 1990, American Law school grads had even distribution of salaries, but by 2000 there was a separation into winners &amp; losers.Both far leftists &amp; far rightists comprise the counter-elite.\n\nThey consider themselves entitled to elite privileges, but the state can't absorb them. \n\nAnd since they seem destined to remain outside privilege, oppose it: If they can't be a part of it, they want to destroy it.Because the cycle isn't over yet, we should expect a full blown political crisis, &amp; then a general breakdown and reset.\n\nEither a positive check (increase in death rate) and/or a negative check (decrease in birth rate)\n\nOne solution is economic growth: https://t.co/ghXx8nq8Dchttps://t.co/tiHgVcsidm",

Management gives you leverage.\n\nOptimizing managing process can have ripple effects in your company.\n\nManagers dictate most of people's experiences at companies.They effectively oversee the social contract btw the company &amp; employee.\n\nIf employee's have a bad experience w/ their manager, they'll likely leave.\n\nManagers are so important Keith Rabois suggests optimizing for your manager as much as the specific company.Good management matters more than ever:\n\nAndy Grove wrote High Output for industrial, conveyor belt era\n\nToday, employees don't just need to be productive, they need to be creative\n\nWhich means they need to be inspired &amp; internally motivated so they can be generative &amp; productiveGreat ICs are expected to become managers, even if they have neither the skillset nor the interest. But being a good IC doesn't make you a good manager.\n\nLet IC's be IC's if they want, &amp; create paths for ppl to be managers.  \n\nPeople aren't born managers. They need to be trained.Onboarding:\n\n- The best indicator of how long someone will stay in the org is their experience in the first day.\n\n- Make sure everything's set up so they can ship something their first day.\n\n- Make sure they can easily understand priorities of the company and where they fit in.How to have a 1:1\n\n- Weekly 30 min 1:1 with your reports\n\n- Update &amp; agenda prepped in advance by the reports\n\n- Align on what are the top three things that are most important to get done by this time next week. Capture those &amp; check in next week:\n\nQ's: https://t.co/kHzetBf0m5Goal setting:\n\nOften problems come up that seem like they're communication problems, but really they're planning problems.\n\nDifferent ways to do goals (e.g OKRs) just make sure they're clear and transparent for everyone across teams to see.Performance Reviews:\n\n- Decouple performance review from compensation bonus (do that before the review)\n\n- The goal is no surprises\n\n- It's a way to retain people, renew commitments, and reset expectations if needed.Feedback:\n\n- Be direct, clear, &amp; concise. Give it during regular 1:1s. \n\n- Make sure you ask for it too, and make it a good experience for the feedback giver or else they won't give it.\n\n- You're looking for people to take ownership &amp; show growth-mindset when taking feedback.Conflict resolution:\n\nWhen people hate each other it's usually because they're not hearing each other.\n\nIf you can get them essentially repeating back what the other person is saying, you'd be surprised at how conflicts can evaporate.\n\nRead NVC: https://t.co/ynIAWSPSW5How to run group meetings well:\n\n- Make sure people are prepped ahead of time (updates published ahead)\n\n- Having a meeting owner to move ppl along\n\n- Also have a note-taker to track decisions &amp; next steps\n\n- Don't create weird incentives where ppl get promoted b/c of face-timeComp:\n\n- More important to figure out what's fair within org than in market, as that's what ppl care more about.\n\n- Different approaches: Uber famously paid 75% of market as a gut check \"How much do you believe this\"? Netflix famously pays aggressive salaries but skimps on equityPerformance Improvement Plan:\n\n- PIPs are opportunities for struggling employees to reinvent themselves.\n\n- \"These were expectations for the role. This is observed performance. This is what we need to do to bridge the gap.\"\n\n- PIPs need to be specific. Not \"Improve communication\"Firing well:\n\n- Fire crisply &amp; kindly\n\n- Don't negotiate\n\n- Don't have long transition periods. Cut the chord.\n\n- Don't demote (usually)\n\n- Don't feel too terrible. You're letting them go to a different company where they will be more valued, more respected, and more successfulMistake founders make:\n\nHero'ing: doing the work themselves on behalf of their reports. \n\nThis is bad because you start resenting your team and because they develop a learned helplessness.\n\nIf you have to do it, acknowledge explicitly you're doing it so it's known it's temporary.Culture:\n\nSolves the resolution to bandwidth problem.\n\nYou can't be involved in every decision as the company grows, so you want to create the cultural infrastructure by which people do what you want them to do when you're not there, when they don't even know you well.Culture: \n\nHaving an explicit culture \"We're for X, not Y\" can be helpful to self-select &amp; stand out: Be known for something or be known for nothing.\n\nPpl think culture is like architecture when more like gardening. You plant some seeds &amp; pull out weeds that aren't working.Culture:\n\nThe best way to influence culture is to hire for it upfront\n\nMake sure you link your hiring process to your annual review\n\nIf you evaluate candidates differently than you evaluate hires, you're not setting team up for success\n\nMore on recruiting: https://t.co/OIH4EOjJRgTime horizons:\n\nEither your company sort of fails very quickly, or all of your problems become in some way about managing growth.\n\nYour time horizons are proportional to company age.\n\nWhen you're 1 month old, you think 1 month ahead.\n\nWhen you're 2 yrs old, you think 2 yrs ahead.Learned a lot talking to @maccaw &amp; reading his book:  https://t.co/gZZhtRalaL",

(e.g housing in 2008)The initial supply shock is similar to trade war last year.\n\nWhen there's a disruption to manufacturing supply chains, that tends to reduce business investment, which puts downward pressure on demand for credit, which (usually) reduces equilibrium interest rates.Also, w/ COVID, there's also a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. \n\nAnd when there's uncertainty, there's a rush for safe assets, people buy treasury bonds, that also puts downward pressure on interest rates. \n\nSo you have this downward pressure on global interest rates.You can think of the equilibrium rate as the rate consistent w/ stable economic growth &amp; consistent w/ the feds targets for inflation &amp; employment.\n\nIf the Fed sets its policy rate too high or too low, we go off track\n\nThis makes ppl think Fed should do nothing, but it's untrueDoing nothing is doing something\n\nIf you want money supply or interest rates to be the same as before, you have to do something to get it there\n\nif velocity slows, to maintain the same monetary policy, you have to increase money supply to offset effects on declining velocityB/c the dollar plays a large role in the global economy, changes in US monetary policy have ripple effects on other countries.\n\nIf Fed doesn't cut rates fast enough, monetary policy gets unintentionally tighter. Side effect of tighter money is the dollar appreciates in fx market.This also happened in the second half of 2008 during the financial crisis:\n\nThe dollar appreciated strongly, and for countries where their currencies are linked to the dollar &amp; that have borrowed a lot of money in dollars, this can become a very big burden.What should Fed do if it becomes a global financial crisis?\n\nTactics:\n\nIn 2008, the Fed extended a number of currency swap lines to a number of central banks across the world. Prob same again\n\nCutting interest rates, QE to address immediate crisis for liquidity, need for stimulusStrategy:\n\nGDP level targeting, but that's unrealistic, so instead level targeting of inflation. \n\nLevel targeting, as opposed to just inflation targeting, forces Fed to be much more serious.\n\nIf Fed overestimates inflation, they actually have to make up for past mistakesMany central banks have had excessively contractionary monetary policy, which has led to inflation &amp; growth not hitting their target.\n\nLow inflation &amp; low growth puts pressure on interest rates\n\nAs interest rates fall, ppl think central banks have easy monetary policy.Which is why people think there aren't many levers for monetary policy. But that's wrong. These low interest rates (&amp; QE) are really a reflection of previous tight money\n\nWe have to ask ourselves two questions:1/ what kind of target do we want for inflation or nominal GDP growth? \n\nThe higher the target, the higher the interest rate, &amp; the less QE you'll have to do, b/c ppl won't want to hold as much cash\n\nWant low inflation rate? (e.g. Japan, Switzerland) Do QE b/c ppl will hoard cash2/ Are we going to tell central banks to do whatever it takes to hit their inflation / growth targets?\n\nOr would we rather give this to fiscal policy?\n\nMonetary policy is less costly b/c it neither adds to our national debt nor puts a big tax burden on future generationsAlso less costly than fiscal policy b/c if the Fed buys a lot of assets, usually it will make a profit (they did in 2008)\n\nBut even if they make a modest loss, that loss is going to be a much smaller burden on future taxpayers than fiscal stimulus would beMaybe there's a chance that, if interest rates fell to zero and they couldn't be cut any further, they Fed could widen the range of assets (e.g. Treasury securities, corporate bonds) they could buy wide enough such that they'd have enough assets to hit a 2% inflation target.We keep seesawing but each time is better than before.\n\nOverreacted on expansionary side in 60s/70s\n\nIn last decade, overreacted on contractionary side\n\nBut 2008 was much better recovery than 1929.\n\nFed should be more responsive to market conditions than Phillips Curve modelsIn conclusion: Desired response is level targeting, ideally of GDP but inflation level targeting will do.\n\nAdditionally, Fed should cut interest rate target b/c I believe equilibrium interest rate has fallen, but cutting interest rates without level targeting isn't enough.",

Parroting high status opinions w/ no logicThankfully we've evolved the perfect equipment (e.g. consciousness) over many years to deceive others by deceiving ourselves\n\nLanguage is a tool to make up excuses to raise your status. That's more or less it\n\nIt's not a receptacle for or the origin of your thoughts, it's a tool.Truth is hard.\n\nNot only are you deceiving yourself all the time to raise your status, but other people are also deceiving you all the time  to raise theirs too.\n\nSo of course being able to manipulate your peers is more important than being able to correctly understand truth.People\u2019s statements are just signals in a long-standing status competition.\n\nKevin Simler and Robin Hanson wrote an entire book on this: https://t.co/NpLkkJw7mA\n\nConflict theory &amp; mistake theory get at two ways to address this: https://t.co/Lc9Z5CMWocTo be sure, Some people do get status from pursuing truth (scientists, writers, academics)\n\nThe more truth they pursue, the more status they get, b/c they're great at it.\n\nBut most people aren't good enough to gain any status from truth-discovery, so they refrain from pursuing itWhy would we be evolved for truth?\n\nIt takes time and effort, and it's not necessary\n\nTruth is often inconvenient for status\n\nIt's more effective to believe self-serving BS\n\nChange the rules of the game. When they go truth, you go BS\n\nWhatever you gotta do to survive &amp; reproduce.People will believe whatever gives them shortest path to social status.\n\nBut you may have noticed that people's actions don't match their beliefs.\n\nFor example, public schools for all, but best teachers for your kids.\n\n\"Egalitarianism when being selected, Elitism when selecting\".People get depressed hearing this, but the deception is not all bad; sometimes you want to hide things.\n\nThe whole concept of \"status\" altogether is a problematic truth, which is why we rarely acknowledge it explicitly and certainly resist making it legible to the internet.\n\nWhy?Genetical survival is often zero-sum, and even when it isn't, competition for mates is zero-sum.\n\nThis is a hard truth to coordinate around (that humans are inherently in conflict) \n\nSo we hide the idea of status &amp; pursue it secretly &amp; subconsciously, deceiving all along the way.So back to people's beliefs\n\nPeople will usually believe whatever improves their short-term status, whatever wins them approval from those they care about\n\n(Pick your role models carefully!)\n\nThe vast majority of ideas don\u2019t have short-term physical consequences; just social onesThis is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. \n\nDifferent ideas suit different people at different times\n\nIdeas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas.Which is why the culture war is so existential.\n\nBecause the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school cafeteria politics\n\nBecause people are just vessels, looking for a hit. They don\u2019t really care where they get it, only that it\u2019s good.Our understanding of the mind still assumes that people have \"ideas\" in their head and that \"reason\" determines how they behave.\n\nDoesn't take status into account.\n\nIt's like the Christian emphasis on \u201cfaith\u201d, i.e that some people have \u201cfaith\u201d, which makes them more noble people.Sometimes the logic gap is so strong that we know we are being deceptive.\n\nThis is what preference falsification is: People holding in their views b/c they're not socially safe.\n\nPpl are just trying to get by. Survive &amp; reproduce.\n\n**\nInterested in hearing feedback on these ideasIn conclusion:\n\n- Status drives behaviors (&amp; beliefs)\n\n- People only pursue (or even perceive) truth when it aligns with an increase in their status\n\n- As such, we've evolved to deceive others &amp; deceive ourselves so we can do that most effectively\n\nSo: Be https://t.co/IpH4Z3Deb3",

    "full_text": "Here's another try at articulating Glen Weyl's ideas / quotes: https://t.co/1WwgUcZr5NYou can think of all the social circles that you're a part of in pre modern society\u2014your work circle, your family circle, your friend circle, all these overlap heavily.\n\nSo you're not really an individual b/c there's so many other people who's their circles are the same as yoursAnd then what starts to happen in modernity is these things start to separate out. \n\nSo maybe you only have two people who are in both your work and home circles. \n\nSo then you end up being the unique intersection of all these different like social groups that gives you meaning.So you can then think of yourself as having a mimetic code, which is made up of precisely these quantitative measures of your commitment to these different communities\n\nAnd what makes you unique is the fact that that mimetic code is not the same as anyone else's mimetic code.So we only get to individual humans, like in the modern era. And the way we get to individual humans is not by like removing social structure, but by adding more social structure\n\nWhat actually creates the potential of being an individual is the plurality of human organizations.What's wrong about the libertarian view is that it fails to realize that it's the combination of private property or extreme individualism w/ the fact that we live in a society that's fundamentally social that creates the conditions that the libertarians are objecting to.So anything that tries to strip away community &amp; reveal the true individual is fundamentally confused\n\nOn the contrary, it's by creating a diverse range of communities--and fluid overlapping emergent identities-- that we actually enable people to be individuals in the first placeEconomics tries to do this, but it's confused\n\nWe consume things in a family--most of the things that like make it nice to be in San Francisco or not like features of my individual home, but features of the ambient environment around there that make it desirable to live thereWe are massively overdetermined. Two thirds of income inequality is across country\n\nThere's just like no possible way that we can in this linear way that private goods wants to attribute it back to the individual.Once you move past that, then like the whole edifice that lies behind utilitarian economics based justifications o f  market capitalism goes away, and you start realizing the enormous complexity of the system that we're actually dealing withthe fundamental problem of economics is not how do you reconcile the individual self interest with the common good, the fundamental problem should be, how do we have cooperation under conditions of diversity?selfishness is not even meaningful, b/c given that nearly all of what we consume is consumed in groups, all there really is is either I'm super aligned with you &amp; there's no conflict of interest btw us at all, or we're distant like, really socially distant &amp; thus there's conflictMechanisms like markets that treat symmetrically the interactions btw two people who are very close to each other, &amp; two people are very far from each other will lead to issues b/c they don't actually overcome the key challenge, which is how to live under conditions of difference",

They'll likely be happy to help you if you're doing well\n\n- Use gathered data to write specs for the role &amp; determine  criteriaWhat do execs need to be able to do:\n\n- Build organizations, often from scratch.\n\n- Also be primary individual contributors.\n\n- Act like an owner &amp; be a team playerUnderstand whether role is value protecting or value creating, and spec accordingly.\n\nCFO at SaaS company = value protection\n\nCFO at Opendoor = value creation\n\nValue protecting, hire for slope\n\nValue creation, hire for experience\n\nhttps://t.co/i8A4tXWvpKHire the best person for the next 9 months, not the next 3 yrs.\n\ni.e.:\n\nIf you find someone who's not good now but good 3 yrs from now, don't hire them. They won't or can't do what you need now\n\nIf you find someone who's good now but not in 3 yrs, hire them. You'll figure it out.Promote from within when you can.\n\nIt's how you keep great people who would otherwise leave for better opportunities elsewhere. It also shows there is upward mobility in the org.\n\nYou can trust them. They already know your culture and have team buy-in.Be careful hiring a big company executive for a startup. \n\nThe skill sets required for a big company exec vs a startup exec are very different. \n\nEven the best big company execs often don't know what to do once they arrive at a startup.If you know what you're doing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about 50/50. \n\nThat is, about 50% of the time you'll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person.\n\nIf you don't know what you're doing, it'll be way worse.Use an exec firm for sourcing, but don't outsource your evaluation, selling, or knowing what you need in the 1st place.\n\nNo one wants to pay $100K to a search firm, but a great exec hire pays back orders of magnitude more than that\n\nAvg time of search is 137 days, so start early!Q's to ask:\n\nIf you were CEO at your last co, what would you do differently? (You want them to be an owner).\n\nWhat's the business equation of your last company? (You want them to be strategic)\n\n\"Who are the people you'd bring along with you?\" (You want them to be a talent magnet)Best interviews are a mix of buying and selling.\n\nBuying - Asking Q's, digging in\n\nSelling - Painting a vision, expressing interest in specific candidate for a specific core part of that vision.\n\nQualify early: Why are they leaving? Why are they potentially interested in joining?On Compensation:\n\nBring it up in the beginning briefly to assure you're in the same ball park, and then don't bring it up again until the end when they're sold.\n\n\"If we're meant to work together, don't want comp to be the reason why we don't.\"After you hire them:\n\n- Manage your executives. Even if you're 20 and they're 70. (e.g. Weekly 1:1s)\n\n- But don't micro-manage (unless temporarily). If you feel urged to, it might mean you don't trust them. Dig into that.\n\n- Ask people under them semi-regularly how they're doing.When should you fire an executive\n\n- When you no longer trust them to build their org &amp; feel compelled to micro-manage.\n\n- Judged by output of their org. Are they hiring? training?\n\n- Andy Grove said you always fire a bad exec too late. If you're really good, 3 months too late.Inspired by ideas in these posts, among others:\n\nhttps://t.co/e8auRnHQZj\n\nhttps://t.co/1A0acxPJcJThis is a follow up to this deep dive on recruiting: https://t.co/OIH4EOjJRg",
