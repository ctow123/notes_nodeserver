  "text": "How does COVID-19 affect LP/VC market for new funds?\n\nSome thoughts paraphrased from a conversation with an older VC who's been through a couple cycles. \ud83d\udc47\n\n(Curious for alternative perspectives.) Zooming out:\n\nLPs used to do 60% public stocks, 40% liquid bonds.\n\nThe next evolution was going heavy into illiquid alternative assets (PE, VC, and natural resources)\n\nYou could arbitrage your long time horizon as an institution to garner outsized gains by embracing illiquidity So they allocated meaningful chunks of portfolio to PE broadly.\n\nMaybe 3/4 buyout funds, 1/4 VC. All illiquid.\n\nOver last decade, all of these have performed well for the most part, which has grown their PE allocations perhaps double where they want to be. Also, there's been a huge expansion in people starting VC/PE funds, raising more money &amp; on quicker time scales.\n\nMore funds getting bigger raising faster.\n\nThe top players in the asset class has been performing, so they've gotten away with it, even though LPs were over-allocated So, imagine in a recession where stock market drops significantly.\n\nLiquid part of the portfolio shrinks.\n\nIlliquid part of the portfolio rises accordingly.\n\nThe illiquid part was too big to begin with!\n\nAnd since liquid part down, that means PE valuations drop too. So the illiquid part isn't going to have the returns they\u00a0thought.\n\nBut the marks on illiquid assets arrive a lot later than public stock\u00a0prices.\n\nSo now they're significantly more allocated to the alternative assets portion of their portfolio (PE/VC)\n\nWhat do they do? Rebalance their portfolios.\n\nSo it looks like less PE/VC as a result.\n\nAnd these are the endowments, the professional LPs.\n\nWhat about the new LPs, who bought in at the top into new funds with no track records?\n\nYep. It's harder for new funds trying to get off the ground now. FIN ",

  "text": "Book notes from Thomas Piketty's \"Capital in the 21st Century\" \ud83d\udc47\n\nCurious to hear critiques &amp; responses to the book.\n\nhttps://t.co/v6E6Zw9SjC Normal economic growth has been between 1-1.5% annually.\n\nWhen it's higher than that it's for 3 reasons:\n\n1- high population growth\n2- temporary bubbles\n3- \"catch up growth\" (e.g. Germany &amp; Japan after WWII) Piketty's main focus is the growing inequality between capital &amp; labor.\n\nA rentier is a person who lives off the interest on savings instead of working (e.g trust-fund kids, landlords)\n\nInequality grows when r &gt; g \u2013 the rate of return from capital is greater than the growth rate. Laborers largely live pay-check to pay-check. So their income grows at the level of GDP per capita.\n\nRentiers live of interest of their principal, so their income largely grows on rate of return on capital (one check on this is pop growth)\n\nhttps://t.co/csGldkILhr When the rate of return on capital exceeds the growth rate of the economy (as it did through much of history until the 19th century and as is likely to be the case again in the 21st century), then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income. In normal times, the rate of return on capital averages about 4% \u2013 5% per year, and the GDP per capita growth rate averages about 1% to 1.5% per year. \n\nSo in normal times, rentiers\u2019 yearly incomes should be growing more than laborers\u2019, which would increase inequality During wars &amp; crises however, rentiers are worse off than laborers relatively. \n\nHyper inflation, asset destruction, gov't interference, wealth taxes, are all likely to hit rentiers the hardest. 1914-1945 was an example of this. Piketty references Jane Austen novels which show how much time money matters take up. \n\nEven with someone who has 5x average income, it was necessary to spend most of one\u2019s time attending to the needs of daily life.\n\nGrateful for economic growth that has changed that for many. Contrary to the popular consensus today, the American Dream was very real for most of America\u2019s history. \n\nThis was due to the fact that America (as a new country) had less time to accumulate a rentier class, which takes a couple generations for the fortunes to really multiply. Rentier class used to be top 1%. Now it's top 0.1%. Why?\n\n- Have a bunch of super laborers who make money both on labor &amp; on their principal (e.g CEOs). Fewer rich bums these days. :)\n\n- Capital is disproportionately tied up in institutions (endowments, sovereign wealth funds) There's growing income in equality among labor. The share of top 10% (top 1% in particular) has been growing for decades.\n\nCEO salary has been rising steadily. Why?\n\n- Maybe it's just the market\n- Maybe it's low taxes relative to 1980s\n- Maybe it's corporate governance The Rich get richer faster than others.\n\nPeople like Bill Gates grow their fortune at 8-10% a year, double Piketty's 4-5% return on capital.\n\nThe richest endowments grow at 10% yearly as well. Medium rich endowments grow at 7-8%. Avg person saving for retirement is 4-5%. All of this suggests increasing global inequality. \n\nWhich is why Piketty suggests a global tax on wealth.\n\nMaybe fixing housing would help here, as that transfers wealth from laborers to rentiers.\n\nOr fixing colleges, which also puts laborers in debt.\n\nOr increasing birth rates. Personally, I am more excited about fixing wealth inequality by enabling people to have equity in companies (perhaps by a token-like mechanism), such that people are directly and legibly aligned with economic growth.\n\nShare the pie as you expand it.\n\nhttps://t.co/XqywrvtVla This was a great book review that inspired these notes as well: https://t.co/guKzjQcn1l ",

Thus he is perfect to be the universal man:\n\nOne who is neither white nor black, and can thus mediate.\n\nAfter social justice activism in Google &amp; Microsoft, no coincidence they chose Indian CEOs.\n\nAfter racial scandals at Yale, Missouri, no coincidence they chose Asian deans. That's why we need an Asian president\n\nAnd of course people chuckle when hearing that\n\nWhy?\n\nWe can't quite articulate it or we wouldn't want to articulate it\n\nBut once you uncover what that reason is, then you start knowing the nature of the Asian American struggle. This is a micro-aggression. Or more precisely in this case, the love not given.\n\nAn acknowledgement of the subtle slights one faces b/c race. Helpful construct.\n\nTaken to the extreme tho, it can be a weapon where you can catch people &amp; invoke administrative power on your behalf. Andrew Yang was the Universal Man manifested.\n\nBecause as an Asian American, he's somehow apart. He could mediate in ways whites can't.\n\nHe won support from:\n\n- Al Sharpton\n- Alyssa Milano\n- Charlamagne Tha God\n- Bret Shapiro\n- Whoopi Goldberg\n- Tucker Carlson\n- Chappelle\n- Rogan Finally, an Asian leader regarded as someone who has vision and not just some tertiary figure whose job is to work on the technical back end of things.\n\nThis mediating figure that nobody can quite attack, that everybody can coalesce around as a kind of compromise candidate. Paradox of Asians:\n\nThey're dramatically *over-represented* in terms of overall academic &amp; economic representation relative to their population\n\nThey're dramatically *under-represented* in terms of corresponding academic &amp; economic representation relative to their accomplishments Back to micro-aggressions:\n\nTaken to extreme, it can spiral, and everyone can turn into an oppressor on some axis.\n\nThe book \"Beauty Pays\" takes a look at the premium that attractive people &amp; tall people get in a pretty systematic fashion.\n\nhttps://t.co/jWWANDmagv There's no immunological defense against any egalitarian claim rn.\n\nAs a result an administrative leviathan is being constructed, a sort of surveillance system meant to police wrongdoing.\n\nDespite the real harm of micro-aggressions, an excessive cure can be worse than the disease Free speech? Due process? Meritocracy?\n\nNew generations of college students have only encountered hostile critiques of these.\n\nThey've only read about social contract theory &amp; everything we've used to become a multi-ethic society as the will to power of an oppressor. Media too has been taken over by a sort of insurgency.\n\nIn the last few yrs (After \"Before Times\"), the ideology of Jezebel became something like the ideology of The New York Times.\n\nLeads to Rotten Tomatoes phenomenon: Chappelle panned by the press, loved by the wider audience. Which is why a mixed martial arts commentator (Joe Rogan) can get more traffic than The Washington Post &amp; NYT combined.\n\nHe's no genius, he's a surrogate for the normal person encountering all of this stuff &amp; looking for someone to make sense of it.\n\n(FYI Rogan supports Sanders) Asians are fighting back against social engineering in NYC school systems.\n\nThere's an anti-meritocratic movement that says meritocracy is white supremacy, and yet the group that is hurt most by fighting meritocracy here is Asians: They outnumber whites in these gifted schools. These aren't rich people. Asians have the highest poverty group of any group in NYC.\n\nThese are the earnestly striving children of working lower middle class, immigrants from China a pretty large percentage of whom are undocumented.\n\nThe ppl these programs are meant to help. There is a small minority speaking behalf of a larger majority, laundering their own individual psychopathology as a form of virtue and we're listening to them even though they don't represent the broader group (e.g only 2% of latinos identify w/ Latinx)\n\nhttps://t.co/Yijg9tthNX These activists have read Foucault, Saul Linsky\n\nThere was this debate in the 90s where you had these activists monkeying around with definition of words &amp; the law, &amp; then you had the real activists on the front lines criticizing the former group.\n\nTurns out the former was right. And so we have law professors whose job is to dream up new ways to define harms &amp; remedies to those harms.\n\nThere's a smaller group of law professors whose job is to ensure the integrity of the law &amp; ensure its basic functioning\n\nOnce these things are laws, they're hard to repeal Paradox is that while wokeness seems to be subsiding in popular culture (see Ricky Gervais), it is gaining more and more power in the institutions (our education systems &amp; law)\n\nhttps://t.co/L6kTtmPNhT Our society is still healthy.\n\nThe freakout that's taken place in the media hasn't impinged upon our core institutions.\n\nAnd the fear is is that at some point, they will, at some point, make its way into muscle and bone and get into the structure of the society and turn it over.

In an honor culture, it is important to refuse to be dominated by anyone.\n\nPeople are highly sensitive to slights and respond to any indication of disrespect with immediate aggression (e.g. dueling)\n\nThey feel appealing to external authority is \"beneath them\" (e.g. snitches) In a victimhood culture, moral status based on suffering. And if victimhood is a virtue, privilege is a vice. It has the same relationship to victimhood that cowardice does to honor. Checking one's privilege is analogous to the shaming of cowards that we see in honor cultures. Disclaimers: \n\n\"To say that being recognized as a victim raises one\u2019s moral status does not imply that any particular victim is cynically taking advantage of this fact. It does not imply that any particular victim sought out or enjoys whatever status victimhood conveys. \"It does not imply that this status outweighs other disadvantages they might have. And it does not imply that anyone\u2019s grievances are illegitimate or that those who point out their marginality are dishonest.\"\n\nAlso there are no judgments between the terms honor, dignity, &amp; victim Explaining their work:\n\n\"Many who showcase their disadvantage are factually correct about their situation, but it's still of sociological interest that they'd advertise it in this fashion, when in other settings they might hide such things or at least not emphasize them.\" In victimhood culture, the main way to gain status is not just to be a victim, but to stand up for other victims. And so even if you're not in a victim class, you can gain status by aggressively defending those who are marginalized\n\noverlap w/ christianity:https://t.co/hL9dD37hk2 In a dignity culture, both force (honor culture) appealing to authority (victimhood culture) are looked down upon\n\nIn honor cultures, being harmed or oppressed can be a source of shame\n\nIn victim culture, we defer to those who have been hurt. Honor culture emerges in places where having a reputation for toughness is valuable for survival.\n\nHonor culture subsided in places that had effective law enforcement and in places where people could achieve commercial independence.\n\nhttps://t.co/Kx5l73AvFh Victim culture hares honor culture\u2019s awareness of offense, but responds w/ appealing to authority instead of direct aggression.  \n\nIt maintains dignity culture\u2019s reliance on 3rd parties to resolve conflict, but dispenses w/ its default to ignore slights or negotiate first. What leads to victimhood culture?\n\nThe presence and power of social superiors in many aspects of our lives makes reliance on third parties increasingly attractive.\n\nCombined with a shortage of strong ties and a surfeit of weak ones, it makes public complaint increasingly likely. Also generational differences in childhood with those growing up in recent decades experiencing drastically higher degrees of adult supervision, regulation, and protection\n\nThis happens partly because of greater involvement in school and other adult-supervised activities. Minorities have often resented slights by the majority, but appealing to authority wasn't feasible\n\nWe've had extreme reliance on third parties in totalitarian states, but little concern w/ equality\n\nThis is perhaps why victimhood culture hadn't emerged as strong in the past.

That's different.\n\nI'm not gonna pave the jungle for you. \n\nPut on some boots &amp; learn to deal w/ adversity.\n\nI'm not gonna take weights out the gym. That's the whole point of the gym.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/jfn8f1f5su Seeing speech as violence has scary implications.\n\nThe state is supposed to have the monopoly on violence, so if speech is violence then gov't can control speech.\n\nAnd if I say that some speech is violent towards me, I now have liberty to use violence back (b/c self defense) 3 great untruths being told today\n\n2/ Always trust your feelings, esp over arguments.\n\nThis doesn't take into account how biased and flawed and often shallow and silly we are.\n\nBut when we push against each other, we challenge each other and we get better we get smarter together. 3 great untruths being told today\n\n3/ Life is a battle btw good people and bad people.\n\nIf you're told this, you're going to be constantly paranoid. You're going to look for the wrong in everything the other side does and you're not going to look to work together. Social Media amplified this.\n\nSince people are arguing in public, they're tempted to show off &amp; win as to not look weak.\n\nYou get \"credit\" for tearing other side down publicly, not having a constructive convo privately\n\nDoes it change them? No, it makes them hate you. Tame vs Wicked Problems\n\nTame = Clear problem, clear solution\n\nWicked = Experts disagree &amp; are guided by value differences.(eg inequality)\n\nWe've solved many tame problems. Low hanging fruit has been picked. Now need to solve wicked problems\n\nWe need view point diversity to do so Human reasoning does not take place in a logical world based on facts. \n\nIt takes place in an emotional world based on stories. \n\nAnd we don't even write these stories. We imbibe them as we grow up.\n\nSo to change people's minds, focus on the stories they're still clutching to Socialism story:\n\nCapitalists got rich by extracting labor from workers.\n\nin 20th century, gov'ts protected workers from greedy capitalists which led to wealth creation &amp; distribution\n\nCapitalists fought back and now rich get richer, poor get poorer, and planet suffers. Capitalism story:\n\nEveryone used to be a peasant\n\nPost-capitalism, many former peasants got rich\n\nAnd yet, capitalism never gets credit it deserves &amp; is constantly under attack\n\nPeople would rather have everyone be equal rather than some get more than others\u2014even if equally poor Thanks to capitalism:\n\n1820 - 95% of the world lived in poverty\n1981 - 52%\n2010 - 20%\n2015 - 9.9% \n\nIt's not just that the rich get richer, it's that everybody gets richer. \n\nAnd then a generation or two later, everyone gets rights. However, progress of a free market society creates conditions that undermine its future success in a few ways:\n\nPpl lose common purpose (or specifically, common enemy) &amp; turn on each other.\n\nHard times create strong men\nStrong men create good times \nGood times create weak men If you think that half the country is 100% wrong, then you're trapped in a moral matrix.\n\nAnd like Matrix the movie, you can either take the blue pill, &amp; stick to your comforting delusions, or you can take the red pill, learn some moral psychology &amp; step outside the moral matrix. Morality binds and blinds. \n\nThere's the politics game, where we do whatever it takes to win.\n\nThen there's also the get to know you game, where the goal is learning and connection.\n\nWe're now in the lawyer game, which is your guilty and you owe me. Don't give an inch. Theories of justice:\n\nUtilitarian view: The greatest good for the greatest number\n\nKantian view: What's right is good\n\nAristotelian view: You get what you deserve\n\nProcedural justice is about fairness of process\n\nDistributive justice is about outcome distributions A university needs to have a central mission and has to be either truth or social justice activism. \n\nIt can't be both. \n\nWe need a schism, we need our universities to clearly declare which way you going.\n\nhttps://t.co/RWmTXCzHAM Any motive besides truth is bad for scholarship bc reasoning is heavily motivated\n\nIf you start by wanting to believe one side of something, you're gonna find evidence for it,&amp; you're gonna conclude that it's true\n\n\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that\" Should a fundamentalist creationist be a geology professor? Probably not.\n\nSo why would we admit someone who's just as fundamentalist about certain moral &amp; political issues into a sociology program or into a psychology program, if they come in committed to a certain POV/outcome? We are fundamentally religious creatures. \n\nAnd it's a great achievement to create a scientific establishment that keeps religious thinking out.\n\nWe must always be vigilant of it popping back up in new forms.\n\nWe separated the church &amp; academy, time to do the same for SJ. Activism *is* very important (as is religion) but it should be susceptible to inquiry.\n\nBy all means, look for injustice, but make sure you know what you're talking about. Back it up w/ reason, not threats. Be able to argue the other side. Be open to changing your mind. \"We need a Geneva convention for the culture war.\"\n\nJust like in a normal war, we make a truce where we won't poison gas, kill children...we should:\n\n- Judge on intent, not just impact\n- Give people benefit of the doubt\n- Embrace inquiry\n- Define terms so compliance is possible \"You can either think of yourselves as being balloons full of feelings in a world full of pins, or you can think of yourselves as fires.\n\nAnd to close, I would just like to say to every student here you are the fire. Now go find some wind\" ",

  "text": "Peter Zeihan is one of the most important thinkers in geopolitics today.\n\nHere are my high level takeaways from his latest book, Disunited Nations, &amp; his recent interviews.\n\nTLDR: US created global order after WWII. US backing out b/c no longer makes sense. Chaos ensues. His books:\n\nAccidental Superpower recounts why U.S. created the global order the way they did &amp; why they are leaving\n\nAbsent Superpower explains the shale revolution &amp; how it accelerates U.S. retreat\n\nDisunited Nations examines who will flourish &amp; struggle in the new (dis)order There have been four ages:\n\nImperial: You didn't trade for things. You stole them. (Britain pre U.S.)\n\nPost WW2: U.S. sacrificed economics for security to fight the Russians\n\n3rd Age: U.S. forgot about the sacrifice after cold war\n\n4th age: U.S. woke up\n\nhttps://t.co/vRMc64S81v Bush HW had best grasp on foreign policy, but was voted out.\n\nClinton focused domestically.\n\nBush W was distracted by 9/11.\n\nObama got it intellectually, but didn't do much.\n\nFor 30 yrs, we had no coherent foreign policy vision.\n\nAnd now Trump is taking sledgehammer to the order. Post WWII, U.S. effectively said:\n\n\"You don't have to worry about wars or invasions or supply routes or food or energy or anything. The global system will take care of it, the US will subsidize and protect the global system.\"\n\nThis won't be true anymore. They're on their own now. This means that countries that depended on the global order will be screwed: China. Germany. Russia. Iran.\n\nThis means that countries that flourished w/o the global order will flourish: Japan. France. Argentina. Turkey.\n\nU.S. is in best position b/c it was least dependent of all What you need to thrive without the global order: \n\n- Perfect geography (mountains good, but oceans better, &amp;  crunchy exterior so ppl can't get to you)\n- Can supply your own food and energy\n- Sustainable population structure\n- Sufficient military resources to protect oneself These four countries are odd contenders in some ways:\n\nArgentina: Special case when it comes to national dsyfunction.\n\nTurkey: been out of commission for a century\n\nFrance: Used to be a major power but Germany best them in a global order world.\n\nJapan: U.S. nuked them twice U.S. in the best position of them all:\n\n- Shale revolution = U.S. energy independent.\n- Only 8% of GDP came from international exchange, so already independent\n- Most balanced population structure\n- Geography: not only is the richest chunk of territory, , it is the most secure. Demographics can be broken into 4 groups:\n\n- Children \n- Young Adults (millennials are holding down the fort when it comes to consumption, at least in U.S)\n- Mature Adults (they work &amp; pay taxes)\n- Retirees (they spend)\n\nIt's important to have balanced ratios between these 4 Japan:\n\n- Strong navy\n- Good geography for their military\n- Expert in de-sourcing \"build where you sell\"\n- It has the capacity to go out and take everything that it needs or interface with friendly countries in order to get what it wants. Turkey:\n\n- Largest army in NATO outside of the United States\n- Recent skirmishes make it \"battle tested\"\n- No one who can really hold a candle to it within its own neighborhood. France is the only significant European country that can take care of itself once the United States leaves \n\n- Stable population structure\n- Didn't internationalize manufacturing\n- Doesn't need global market to sell to\n- Doesn't have security concerns Germany has Argentina:\n\n- Has absolutely everything it needs within its own borders\n- Faces no security threats\n- Has natural resources the rest of world needs (energy, raw materials, food)\n- Good demographics\n- Great geography Why can't another country pick up where US left off?\n\n- Germany doesn't have military strength\n- China can't reach beyond the first island chain\n- French are regionally obsessed \n- Japanese don't want to go beyond Pacific\n- British are out of practice China is in tough place:\n\n- One child policy led to not enough consumers &amp; workers, &amp; too many retirees\n- Import 85% of their energy, that goes away\n- They can't maintain their food output \n- Low naval capacity\n- Credit &amp; debt bubble\n- Can't keep up food production w/o imports Many ways China can implode in next 10 yrs. E.g:\n\n- Lack of consumers &amp; aging work-force\n- Energy crisis in Middle East\n- Export industry collapses\n\nEvery pillar that China has used to base their entire civilization on is beyond their control, &amp; it's all cracking at the same time Germany also in tough spot:\n\n- Bad demographics (not enough kids)\n- Not enough consumers\n- No military\n- Precarious geographical position\n- Internationalized manufacturing\n- Energy comes from Russia\n- Dependent on trade for 2/3 of GDP Russia also in a tough spot:\n\n- Bad demographics (too many old &amp; sick)\n- Need to annex countries (Ukraine, Baltic States) just to be physically secure &amp; will do once they're sure NATO &amp; U.S. is gone Britain also in a tough spot:\n\n- Will lose access to European market b/c of Brexit\n- Will beg U.S. for trade deal and accept U.S. demands which will put them in competition w/ Mexico\n- London loses its place as financial center of the world, which it had b/c it represented EU Brazil also in a tough spot:\n\nThe Brazilian situation has only really been successful in an era where global capital costs are low, global transport is safe and global demand for the products is bottomless, which has been true since 1995.\n\nNot anymore. Middle east = chaos.\n\nB/c of shale revolution, everything that's kept the U.S.  bound to this region (i.e. oil) is no more\n\nThat cuts Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia's biggest economic lifeline. They were basically rentier states w/ one commodity\n\nRebuilding that economy will take centuries. Ironic that the countries most hateful of the global order and U.S. management of it (e.g. Iran, Russia, somewhat China) are its biggest beneficiaries, &amp; will suffer the most when it's gone.\n\nAll U.S. has to do to destroy these countries is go home. And that's what they're doing. U.S. Politics\n\nElectoral college incentivizes split into two parties\n\nParties have a choice of casting wide net or forming alliances\n\nDemocrats cast a wide net, Republicans form alliances\n\nDemocrats have more factions, but more voters. Republicans have fewer #s, but more coherent Factions are reshuffling.\n\nTrump has excised national security conservatives, &amp; fiscal/biz voters from republican coalition, &amp; courted new factions (e.g. labor)\n\nDemocrats reoriented too (e.g pro-immigration)\n\nReshuffling is common: https://t.co/G9yCiJAq3X No matter what, The U.S. is condemned to be an economic, financial, cultural, industrial, &amp; military superpower, per Zeihan. \n\nDecades of bipartisan effort have yet to screw this up yet, &amp; likely won't in 2020.\n\n/FIN\n\nTo learn (much) more, read the book:\n\nhttps://t.co/t1Qhuo2NW2 Curious for all feedback &amp; counter-arguments.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed @PeterZeihan's latest interview w/ @patrick_oshag: https://t.co/c7Wv3hwlFI ",

It becomes infinite, but only after infinite time\n\nWith hyperbolic growth, it can't keep growing forever, it becomes infinite at a definite time. As population growth became hyperbolic, we started to predict the timing of the singularity.\n\nBut every time we got close to it, popularity growth started to slow down. Makes sense.\n\nPopulation growth can't literally be infinite. So something has to give.\n\nhttps://t.co/YXYs05gAbi We've had three phases of major demographic and technological growth when humanity was closing on\nthe singularity (early Bronze Age, early Iron age, early Renaissance)\n\nAnd two phases when it was either stagnant or moving away (middle &amp; late bronze age, black death) https://t.co/j6DDurlQNB Times of population growth coincided with major tech revolutions (e.g. Bronze, Iron, Industrialization).\n\nTimes of stagnation coincide with hegemonic world orders (e.g. strong &amp; bureaucratic state, collectivism, corporatism\u2014sound familiar?) A sign of stagnation is that it there's a relative lack of new ideas to challenge the prevailing world order.\n\nStagnation also means everyone is competing for status since the pie isn't expanding.\n\nThere's some stability, but it's short-term. \n\nEventually individualism re-emerges So the phase of population growth coincides with individualism &amp; rationalism, and the phase of decreased population coincides with collectivism &amp; mysticism\n\nThe latter is not a dark age, b/c there's stability &amp; gov't power, but it's not a Golden age either, b/c it's authoritarian https://t.co/9UsuWFOIqx They have effective government like Golden Ages, but aren't creative like them. \n\nThey're stagnant like Dark Ages, but aren't chaotic like them. \n\nThey're a combination of Golden &amp; Dark Age\u2014A Brown Age.\n\nThere are 4 types of ages: Green, Yellow, Brown, Black. Population on Y axis https://t.co/cswS1Ax0zg Green is creative, but chaotic.\n\nGolden is still creative, but has an effective state (i.e. not chaotic).\n\nBrown has an effective state but is no longer creative.\n\nDark is still not creative, but becomes chaotic. https://t.co/GUruXGxahs Implications of Brown Age:\n\n- Strong surveillance state indoctrinating&amp;enforcing collectivist ideals\n- Suppression of individualism &amp; independent thoughts\n- Lack of tech innovation\n- Equality over freedom, harmony over competition, centralized planning over evolutionary processes This back &amp; forth is cyclical:\n\nE.g. The invention of the printing press led to a proliferation of independent publishing, which was eventually brought back under state &amp; corporate control through censorship &amp; the libel laws, &amp; the building up of a few dominant publishing houses. https://t.co/N51hoHmac5 I summarized all of this from what seems to be an anonymous Youtube channel, so take it for what it's worth.\n\nHere's the specific video: https://t.co/O7LX0rTNif\n\nAdditive commentary is welcome ",

  "text": "Deep Dive into Marketplaces:\n\n- Vertical marketplaces\n- B2B marketplaces\n- Unit economics\n- Case studies\n- Understanding liquidity\n- Mistakes founders make\n\nHigh-level overview  \ud83d\udc47 First, why are marketplaces great businesses?\n\n- Network effects bring high barriers to entry \n\n- No inventory means cheaper to operate (e.g. Airbnb vs. hotels)\n\n- No inventory means easier to scale (e.g. Rover vs. dog hotels)\n\n- No inventory means easier to pivot Marketplaces vs E-commerce:\n\nMarketplaces over time\n\n- CAC lowers\n- Retention increases\n- AOV increases\n- Hard to get initial liquidity but gets easier b/c network effects\n\nE-commerce is the opposite of the above. It has to rely on economies of scale or adjacent markets to scale Marketplace Eras:\n\nListing Era provided lead gen. (e.g. Craigslist, Grubhub, Yelp)\n\nTransactional marketplaces facilitated transactions on platform. (e.g. Thumbtack, Fiverr)\n\nManaged Marketplaces integrated w/ supply or owned supply outright (e.g. Honor, Clutter) https://t.co/zKAxOTer3N Managed Marketplaces:\n\nBear take: Capital intensive, lower margins, less scalable, handicap network effects b/c you commoditize supply \n\nBull take: It's a more controlled &amp; thus higher quality experience, can do lower margins if TAM is in trillions (e.g. healthcare Vertical marketplaces:\n\nEnable a 10x better experience.\n\nFor example, you could buy tickets on Craigslist &amp; eBay.\n\nBut Stubhub integrated w/ ticket providers so you could also verify identity and get seating charts.\n\nSlice does this for pizza ordering. Vertical marketplaces\n\n\"1- Look at large horizontal marketplaces, identify the verticals w/ low NPS, &amp; use product to leapfrog the liquidity of the incumbent\u2019s supply base\n\n2- Nail a small, overlooked and under-appreciated niche, then land &amp; expand from there\"\n\n- @sarahtavel Vertical vs Horizontal Marketplaces:\n\nIf you play this out 10 years, can you imagine people have 20 apps for different service categories on their phone? Probably not.\n\nSo vertical marketplaces either likely have to expand and become horizontal, or get acquired. Double commit marketplaces: Marketplaces that pick supply for you (e.g. Uber).\n\nIf you do enough work, it looks like the marketplace is the provider rather than the individual suppliers (e.g. Amazon).\n\nFor this to work you need to highly curate supply and  match effectively. B2B Marketplaces:\n\nWhy Now? \n\n- After 10+ yrs of consumer marketplaces, we're finally getting to b2b.\n\n- Today's business owners are more tech-savvy.\n\n- B2B requires domain experience to see the opportunity, unlike consumer\n\n- Selling to SMEs where they are fragmented. Factors of a Healthy Marketplace:\n\n- Fragmented supply\n- Not prone to monogamy (e.g babysitters)\n- User experience has to be 10x better than status quo\n- Low friction for supplier to sign up\n- High frequency &amp; high AOV\n- In the payments flow\n- Good reason to stay on platform Labor Marketplaces:\n\n- If you're successful, you lose a customer (they get a job). Thus more of a marketing play\n\n- Vertical marketplaces unbundling LinkedIn can work if they offer value beyond job (e.g RigUp creates a network of profiles for the industry, including reviews etc) Human capital marketplaces:\n\nBiggest underutilized asset of all time is people's time: https://t.co/LkmbaVK5wi\n\nP2P Marketplaces: https://t.co/iowARJuJ1S\n\nLots of data that can be leveraged for people matching (e.g what I'm reading, purchasing, etc) Building marketplaces:\n\n- Identify \"red hot center\" - the group that feels the pain most acutely b/c they'll jump through hoops to use the product initially.\n\n- Main way to create magic for demand is to have the right supply. If you have exclusive lock over supply, that's a moat. How to solve Chicken &amp; Egg problem:\n\nConstrain marketplace to a geo or category you can own\n\nNail one side of the marketplace (usually supply)\n\nBiggest way to grow supply is sales ppl.\n\nBiggest way to grow demand is word of mouth--or when supply brings demand (e.g. Eventbrite) Liquidity is what matters:\n\nCraigslist even w/ horrible experience did $1B last yr b/c of liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is basically how well that you can satisfy user demand. How well supply and demand value props match. Conversion rate is one proxy for that. Redefine the atomic unit of supply and therefore dramatically expand the addressable supply.\n\nHomeAway stayed limited to vacation home rentals until Airbnb redefined and expanded the atomic unit of supply which enabled them to own it instead of share it. \n\nhttps://t.co/ZRes9bhCkd Correct post link here: https://t.co/1fTp9xa5Um Leverage an underutilized fixed asset \n\nEnables supplier acquisition to scale a lot easier\n\nHipcamp leverages underutilized land\n\nCloudkitchens leverage underutilized kitchens\n\nAirBnB leverages underutilized properties\n\nUber leverages underutilized cars\n\nhttps://t.co/vGK8Aoeube Unit economics:\n\n- Recoup fully loaded cost CAC on a net contribution margin basis in the first 6 months of the business\n\n- 3x your CAC in 18 months\n\n- Don't know LTV in beginning b/c you have negative churn Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Overvalue GMV growth, undervalue net revenue &amp; unit economics. Not charging\n\n- Overvalue growth at expense of liquidity &amp; creating more value for incremental next user\n\n- Relying on paid acq.\n\n- Scale too quickly instead of \"nail it before you scale it\" On whether to expand verticals:\n\nThe Q to ask is \"Does this lead to stronger PM-fit, or am I expanding just b/c I'm supposed to?\"\n\nAirBnB smartly didn't expand immediately to AirBnB for dogs, boats, etc.\n\nRover waited too long to expand.\n\nMost cos expand too fast though. Business model:\n\nCharge whichever side is more inelastic (less likely to switch)\n\nOne trick: Offer a free, high quality B2B SaaS tool to your suppliers to attract them to your marketplace. e.g. Fresha Mean valuations for marketplace businesses:\n\nSeed (pre-launch): 1 on 5-6M post\nSeed (150k/mo.

Those ideas change. I'm referring to the broader trend of egalitarianism eats the world.\n\nThe Left is egalitarianism, and the world has increasingly gotten more egalitarian overtime. \n\nhttps://t.co/xluhnAtug6 By \"Left\" and \"Right\" I mean the specific tactics, not policies. The latter are accessories\n\nThe Left wants change. (\"progress, right side of history\"\n\nThe Right wants the status quo (\"order, harmony\")\n\nSo the the left sets the agenda and the right reacts\n\nhttps://t.co/jiYZFRGhme The Right often just wants to survive\n\nThe Right by definition reacts against the Left, whatever the Left is at that moment\n\nThe Right's ruled by high status people who wanna freeze time to preserve status\n\nThe Left's ruled by high status people who want to raise it even higher If The Left is about raising status for self &amp; all (equality), The Right is about preserving the status quo.\n\nThe main way the right can compete with the left is by adopting the same tactics. But it turns them evil.\n\n(e.g. Fascists used communist tactics against the communists.) So why does Left keep winning?\n\nDominion: The Left is just an extension of Christianity without Christ\n\nUniversalism is the idea that there are universal human rights and that all people are created equal\n\nThe translation of catholicism is \"universalism\"\n\nhttps://t.co/e373Efk4Hw Why else do they win?\n\n- We evolved in egalitarian forager groups, so egalitarianism naturally resonates w people\n\n- Promising people higher status is a brilliant strategy: https://t.co/tfYf9JwYtn\n\n- The Left is better at organizing (compared to, say libertarians) &amp; wants it more Scarface: \u201cFirst you get the money, then you get the power...\u201d\n\nThe left goes straight to power, using the state as the mechanism to achieve its goals.\n\nWhich is why they keep trying to load up the state with power even when the state is run by someone they hate, like right now. It\u2019s also why they dislike capitalism\n\nCapitalism and wealth creation is power outside the state\n\nAnything that promotes agency, individual responsibility, free speech\u2014these are all against the state expanding power, so they don't like it\n\nThe more dependent folks are, the better Of course, there are benefits of egalitarianism up to a point.\n\nWhere's that line?\nWhere's the in-between?\nWho are the moderates?\n\nToo much egalitarianism and you destroy excellence.

Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles of company building There is a narrative that founders have to either be college friends or worked together before\n\nI think this is less true than we think\n\nFounders of Coinbase initially met on Reddit I believe?\n\nFounders of Stemcentrx met on Craigslist!\n\nYou might be too afraid to fire your friend Back when, ppl were embarrassed to say they met their spouse via apps, &amp; instead prefer \"at a bar\".\n\nToday, a curated app sounds more thoughtful than the randomness of a bar.\n\nSo with co-founders too: We'll laugh at how we preferred the randomness of school to an app or program. Just like many marriages end up in divorce, and so it\u2019s worth rethinking the dating/matching process\u2014\n\nOne of biggest killer of startups is founder breakups, and so it\u2019s worth re-considering co-founder matching. If you don\u2019t already have a cofounder in your network, how do you \u201cdate\u201d?\n\nBuild top of funnel by:\n\n- Telling the world what you\u2019re thinking (e.g. writing a post, hosting a meetup, etc)\n- Join On Deck (https://t.co/dw9qXrOjiF)\n- Build an audience: What to look for in a co-founder?\n\n- Complimentary skills (how do you, together, have an unfair advantage?)\n- Value-mission alignment (what success looks like, etc)\n- Company alignment (who makes decisions, what tradeoffs you will/won\u2019t accept) You\u2019ve found the person, but you don\u2019t want to shot-gun--then what?\n\n- Go on a road trip or other intense experience (e.g. live together)\n- Do a hackathon (or work together in trying conditions)\n- Meet the spouse and/or parents if you can (seriously!) Non-obvious Q\u2019s to ask:\n\nIn what ways are you crazy? What are your failure modes?\n\nWhat was it like working with ex co-founders?\n\nIf this didn't work out, why not?\n\nWhat's most important to you ($? Managing People? Fame?)\n\nWho should be CEO? Who has the vision? When picking co-founders, it's important to know:\n\n\"Are you the co-founder who has clarity around the vision or are you the co-founder that's gonna build it?\"\n\nFailure mode: Both think they're in charge of vision, &amp; then they constantly butt heads over what direction to go in. Another common co-founder failure mode: Different goals.\n\nOne co-founder wants to make $50m from their startup in 5 yrs, and another wants to never sell.\n\nSometimes you can reconcile different goals, you just have to ensure they're not incompatible w/ each other long-term Talk early and often about:\n\n- What success looks like (outcomes, culture, roles)\n- Non-negotiables\n- Who\u2019s in charge in case of disagreement\n\nOn this last point: Make sure there is a clear CEO / tie-breaker\n\nWork together under stress early so you can simulate hard times. Early on also figure out:\n\n- Personal runway &amp; how much salary they'd need\n- Other extenuating life circumstances \n- 5-20 yr vision for their lives\n- How each wants to scale w/ the company\n- Equity split (prob 50/50) You don\u2019t need to be best friends. (Or even friends at all.)\n\nYou need to respect &amp; trust each other, communicate effectively, and work well together in accomplishing company goals. \n\nAnd not hate going to work every day. Cofounder relationships are like marriages, and should be treated as such\u2014something work on consistently.\n\n- Read relationships/communication books (e.g NVC)\n- Both see a coach\n- Date first. \"Try before you buy\"\n\nBut just like marriage, if it's too much work might not be a fit. What kills startups is never finding Product Market Fit &amp; co-founder issues.\n\nMinimize co-founder issues so you can maximize time spent on finding PMF.\n\nPlus, most co-founder issues stem from not enough PMF to begin with.\n\nSome stem from too much, but those are the good kind. :) Treat co-founder search like any other recruiting process:\n\nhttps://t.co/dCz3y47WX3 ",

Most of tech's opponents were on the broad implicit right \u2014 Republicans, mega corporations, military dictators that Twitter overthrew, etc.\n\nLike Netflix to the studios, at first tech helped the left (e.g. helped Obama rise to power, led to Arab Spring, etc) But after Jobs\u2019 death in 2011 and Obama\u2019s election in 2012, though, other parts of the Democratic Party started to look at tech not just as a ready source of $ and talent, but as a possible threat.\n\nFor the left, they'd outlived their usefulness, overstayed their welcome. Tech had gone so far left it had ended up on the right.\n\nChina/Russia did this but in a different way. Went so far with communism they ended up on the nationalist right. In 2011, tech stopped becoming beloved to the left (&amp; started threatening their existence) for the following reasons.\n\n- Economically attacking traditional American left power centers (NYT, Hollywood, Academia)\n\n- Undercutting prestige &amp; influence (e.g. fake news) - Pulling away top talent to tech companies\n\n- Becoming a more powerful global culture exporter\n\n- Building a network of super-wealthy people w/ an alternative network and path to power (Instead of become president, become CEO).\n\n- The outcome of 2016 election. One thing they implicitly mean by \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d is that tech is disruptive to how they work:\n\nHarvard does a study, NYT reports it, US gov\u2019t enacts it\n\nWhat do they want?

  "text": "Deep dive into some of Rene Girard's thoughts on mimetic desire, scapegoating, and Christianity \ud83d\udc47\n\nPrevious TLDR: https://t.co/QVvljjocfH ~All non instinctual desire is mimetic\n\nWe want things not because they are inherently desirable, but because someone else's desire for them has made them attractive to us.\n\nhttps://t.co/9mslUXAj3r We desire not so much someone's car or house as much as the quality of being that seems to belong to the people who have those possessions\n\nDesire is never just a straight line between a subject and an object, but always has some other as its model.\n\nDesire is shaped by imitation Other animals imitate, but they don't imitate to the degree we do. We don't just imitate on a monkey see/do level. We imitate on a perception level. We imitate what we perceive our neighbor's desires to be. We don't first think &amp; then desire\u2014the opposite.\n\nhttps://t.co/ruyPD58Jdy The more similar we are, the more we'll want the same things\n\nAnd the more we want the same things, the more we'll tend to fight over the scarce good (or status)\n\nAnd so we face a permanent threat of runaway violence\n\nConflict brings convergence, which then brings more conflict. We want others to love what we love, admire what we admire, but when they do, we suddenly find that they have become competitors, leading to conflict\n\nMentor/mentee dynamic is a perfect example. Master wants pupil to imitate the master up until the pupil becomes the master. The first cultures dealt with threat of runaway violence  by transferring their violence to a surrogate victim, a scapegoat whose death/expulsion unites and ends violence\n\nThe antidote to chaos is the ritual scapegoating of a common enemy\n\n\"the foundational murder\" / \"noble lie\" And because the community owes its entire order to its victim, the victim is worshipped as scared\n\nBut at the same time, the victim is also believed to be  guilty, and therefore deserving of the collective violence\n\nScapegoating worked in restoring order, so people kept doing it People need something to blame to hide from the fact that they are angry out of endlessly imitating each other. \n\nNeed a safe space to place all their violence.\n\nScapegoating is the protection of the community against violence that it could not otherwise control The scapegoat ritual addresses the threat of uncontrolled violence, which is endemic to human society b/c of runaway mimetic desire leading to conflict. \n\nRituals of sacrifice averted this crisis by reconciling everyone around a sacrificial victim. \n\nIt's a collective release. However, scapegoating preserves social peace only so long as the scapegoaters think it's justified\n\nThat, after all, was the definition of scapegoating: persecution of an innocent victim believed to be guilty\n\nChristianity, of course, inverts this myth. Now the victim's innocent If you see the truth of that violence, suddenly that violence repels you\n\nJesus's cross instead of ratifying his guilt, proclaims his innocence\n\nBefore the cross, every violence is portrayed as heroic in literature\n\nNow, not anymore. Scapegoating's no longer sacred. Left a vacuum Jesus says, If you have to imitate someone, imitate me, because I won't imitate others and I won't become your rival. And imitate others who imitate me too.\n\nInstead of eye for an eye, turn the other cheek. \n\nInstead of sanctifying sacrificial violence, sanctify love and mercy. Jesus introduced a new spirit of self-awareness &amp; self-criticism\n\nMore so than anytime in history, we're aware of our faults. The west is the only place where we self-flagellate our own culture to gain status\n\nIronically, this is Christianity w/o Christ\n\nhttps://t.co/hL9dD37hk2 Today, we see the violence of Christianity, we don't see the violence, Christianity has prevented all through history\n\nChristianity didn't invent violence, but it did contribute to curbing it\n\nWhere did we get your sensitivity to violence, after all? Certainly wasn't Oedipus Rex Eye for an eye today seems primitive, but at the time it was revolutionary. It advocated for reciprocal violence instead of escalation, which used to be the norm. \n\nB/c we don\u2019t want to renounce scapegoating, we keep attempting sacrificial violence, but it doesn\u2019t bind us anymore Remember, the importance of sacred sacrificial violence in the primordial past was that it bound us together. It prevented us from contagiously envying one another to the point where we\u2019re obsessed with destroying each other rather than just getting on with life. Ironically, as society became both more egalitarian and meritocratic, and hierarchies were less rigid, mimetic competition skyrocketed.\n\nWhere previously people were only competing with their own caste, now they were competing with everyone in the world, &amp; expected to win. Chaos. Nietzsche knew that Christianity was the reason why that resentment was building to such a deep level that once we killed the idea of a God that kept hierarchies stable, mimetic mayhem would ensue\n\nResentiment is a begrudging those who you perceive to have things that you desire We didn't stop burning witches bc of the scientific method, we got the scientific method bc we stopped burning witches\n\nIf, say, ppl's crops were dying, &amp; they burned a \"witch\", &amp; then crops grew, they kept doing it\n\nWhen they stopped, they could evaluate other reasons (science!) People will always find scapegoats.\n\n\"Experience suggests that if men cannot struggle on behalf of a just cause b/c that just cause was victorious in an earlier generation....They will struggle, out of a certain boredom: for they cannot imagine living in a world without struggle\" Today it's this game of guilt, hot potato, where we're becoming more increasingly haunted by our guilt in collective violence. And we're trying to throw that hot potato onto somebody else\n\nScapegoating used to literally mean the transferring of sins to the goats. Now we do people We\u2019re half Christian. \n\nWe\u2019re thoroughly within the fishbowl of Christianity, but we\u2019re, only half Christian in the sense that we\u2019re aware of victimization, but we don\u2019t want to fully recognize how it affects what we do today, and so we justify violence in victimization's name Today, we have new problems. \n\nJesus popped the scape goat bubble told us to imitate him, but we don't want to anymore. \n\nMob frenzies and scapegoating are society trying to purge itself of its own\u00a0demons. Secular Christianity imports from real Christianity what Nietzsche called \u201cslave mentality\u201d, the glorification of the victim. \u201cThe first shall be last and the last shall be first.\u201d And so if your sense of self identity and morality is all wrapped up in that, then any differential success you or other people may achieve is evidence of evil\n\nAnd so the source of that evil must be identified and eliminated. The cycle will repeat until either every possible scapegoat is dead or the movement burns itself out.\n\nWe all have the motivation to purge our sense of collective sin, independent of the guilt or innocence of the subject.\n\nAnd the overpowering need to participate. In a post-modern world, what's the answer?\n\nLiberalism. Tolerance. Due process. Reason. Free speech.\n\nhttps://t.co/wog92EwQ5b\n\nThese are more scattered thoughts than a deep dive, would welcome any follow up analyses or your own takeaways from Girard. ",

Give it during regular 1:1s. \n\n- Make sure you ask for it too, and make it a good experience for the feedback giver or else they won't give it.\n\n- You're looking for people to take ownership &amp; show growth-mindset when taking feedback. Conflict resolution:\n\nWhen people hate each other it's usually because they're not hearing each other.\n\nIf you can get them essentially repeating back what the other person is saying, you'd be surprised at how conflicts can evaporate.\n\nRead NVC: https://t.co/ynIAWSPSW5 How to run group meetings well:\n\n- Make sure people are prepped ahead of time (updates published ahead)\n\n- Having a meeting owner to move ppl along\n\n- Also have a note-taker to track decisions &amp; next steps\n\n- Don't create weird incentives where ppl get promoted b/c of face-time Comp:\n\n- More important to figure out what's fair within org than in market, as that's what ppl care more about.\n\n- Different approaches: Uber famously paid 75% of market as a gut check \"How much do you believe this\"? Netflix famously pays aggressive salaries but skimps on equity Performance Improvement Plan:\n\n- PIPs are opportunities for struggling employees to reinvent themselves.\n\n- \"These were expectations for the role. This is observed performance. This is what we need to do to bridge the gap.\"\n\n- PIPs need to be specific. Not \"Improve communication\" Firing well:\n\n- Fire crisply &amp; kindly\n\n- Don't negotiate\n\n- Don't have long transition periods. Cut the chord.\n\n- Don't demote (usually)\n\n- Don't feel too terrible. You're letting them go to a different company where they will be more valued, more respected, and more successful Mistake founders make:\n\nHero'ing: doing the work themselves on behalf of their reports. \n\nThis is bad because you start resenting your team and because they develop a learned helplessness.\n\nIf you have to do it, acknowledge explicitly you're doing it so it's known it's temporary. Culture:\n\nSolves the resolution to bandwidth problem.\n\nYou can't be involved in every decision as the company grows, so you want to create the cultural infrastructure by which people do what you want them to do when you're not there, when they don't even know you well. Culture: \n\nHaving an explicit culture \"We're for X, not Y\" can be helpful to self-select &amp; stand out: Be known for something or be known for nothing.\n\nPpl think culture is like architecture when more like gardening. You plant some seeds &amp; pull out weeds that aren't working. Culture:\n\nThe best way to influence culture is to hire for it upfront\n\nMake sure you link your hiring process to your annual review\n\nIf you evaluate candidates differently than you evaluate hires, you're not setting team up for success\n\nMore on recruiting: https://t.co/OIH4EOjJRg Time horizons:\n\nEither your company sort of fails very quickly, or all of your problems become in some way about managing growth.\n\nYour time horizons are proportional to company age.\n\nWhen you're 1 month old, you think 1 month ahead.\n\nWhen you're 2 yrs old, you think 2 yrs ahead.

They expect 20% of their content to be non-music and acquired Gimlet &amp; Anchor. https://t.co/m9lGmR0kF2 Power law:\n\nThe median podcast only has 124 downloads per episode \u2014 but the top 1% has 35K downloads per episode. https://t.co/M4chOXuuX8 A taxonomy of podcast creators\n\n- Media companies that have internal podcast departments (e.g NYT Daily)\n\n- Podcast production companies (e.g. Gimlet) \n\n- Large indies and personality-driven talk shows\u00a0(e.g. Tim Ferriss) https://t.co/tLspOAH5pp Big opportunity (natch!) in monetization\n\nThe current state of monetization in podcasting mirrors the early internet: revenue lags behind attention. https://t.co/V1ycO5jRbC Podcast revenue is growing, but still pales in comparison to other mediums.\n\nPodcasts monetize at 0.01 per listener hour, on avg 10x less than radio https://t.co/JtLcLAcUZr Why is podcasting monetization so low? \n\n- Can't monetize on Apple\n- Long tail not big enough to monetize. \n- Detailed listener data is not available &amp; lack of sophisticated targeting tools. Startups in China have figured out monetization: there\u2019s advertising, subscriptions, a la carte purchases, and donations/tipping. What's holding podcast industry back?\n\nNot enough big exits!\n\n\"The industry hasn\u2019t yet seen a \u201cFacebook buys Instagram\u201d moment \u2014 or a large independent company emerge.\" https://t.co/4UlBQwBL2q Trends:\n\n1. Consumer listening apps for general podcast content (improving discovery, adding social layer, offering transcription or context)\n\n2. Vertical consumer audio apps (e.g. MoveWith for fitness)\n\n3. Podcast production companies (e.g Gimlet, WaitWhat) https://t.co/vcmPY5oKXN Startup whitespace:\n\n- Focus on\u00a0audio\u00a0content beyond podcasts\n\n- High-quality differentiated and deeper content vs. broad, free libraries of shallower content.\u00a0\n\n- Consumption experience that enhances the experience of the audio content.\u00a0\n\n- Alternative monetization\u00a0beyond ads. Other things to consider:\n\n1. Vertical audio platforms (e.g. Calm for X)\n\n2. Interactive, social audio (e.g. Clubhouse!)\n\n3. Platforms that helps creators own their end users and monetize content (e.g. Substack, The Athletic)\n\nThx to @ljin18 @avesegal @btcarroccio for the piece. ",

Early days customer success person is helping drive product market fit by helping the engineers understand what are people using.\n\nOver time CS managers get more metrics driven and start owning renewals. What are you looking for in your first customer success manager in the early team, maybe even before selling?\n\nA strong utility player who can wear different hats from training the customer to supporting them to getting feedback to working w/ product What's profile of CS manager?\n\nIf your product is a little bit more transactional, they tend to me more product-oriented\n\nIf it's a high touch enterprise type deal, they tend to be a little more consultative Common mistake founders make about customer success:\n\nIn the beginning, CS managers need to be catch-all, but a mistake is keeping them as catch-all as you scale.\n\nYou should have a person doing training, another onboarding, etc How to justify cost for CS as you scale?\n\nYou could say it's just cost of doing business, like support costs.\n\nAnother way is saying this is part of renewals expansion\n\nAnother is charging for it directly. Why does CS matter more today than it used to?\n\nBefore SaaS became dominant business model, you used to pay for everything upfront.\n\nNow, it's pay as you go, and there's so many other competitors, that you have to keep earning your customer's business every step of the way. How else did this change building SaaS businesses? You now needed:\n\n- More agile product strategy\n- Different GTM strategy (old model was expensive sales channel partners. In new model, deals are smaller &amp; higher velocity)\n- Marketing &amp; product can't be silo'ed What metrics should CS managers prioritize?\n\nLagging indicators - Gross Retention Rate &amp; Net Renewal Rate (includes upsell) &amp; NPS\n\nLeading indicators - Depends on product but could be overall adoption, daily active usage, NPS, e-mail engagement, Much of this was inspired by @nrmehta, CEO of @GainsightHQ and author of \"Customer Success\"\n\nhttps://t.co/0eKXgcOT0j\n\nI went deeper w/ him here: https://t.co/BQ0vM9BFxz ",

Address all the reasons why you wouldn't invest in your hypothetical company in your pitch, b/c VCs will have the same objection. \n\nConsider onion theory of risk: https://t.co/aJCrFJbEfh https://t.co/QC3tXTzY4M Q's you should have good answers for:\n\n- What's your unique insight?\n- What's your unfair advantage?\n- How does this become a $10B biz?\n- Unit economics?\n- Defensible?\n- What is GTM, now and overtime?\n- What have you proven so far?\n- Biggest risk?\n- What will you prove by the A? How much money should you raise? \n\nBefore PM-fit, raise enough to get there\n\nAfter PM-fit, raise enough fully exploit the opportunity &amp; get to profitability\n\nEnough = More than you think you should, to buy yourself insurance against both internal &amp; external potential bad events Checklist: \n\nTraction\u2014You have early signals around usage or engagement that indicate a modicum of PM fit\n\nGo-to-market\u2014You know who your customer is, how to reach them, &amp; validated someone is willing to pay.\n\nFundraise\u2014You know your milestones &amp; how the $ will help you get there Before starting a process (or even months before), consider meeting with 3-5 \"friendlies\" who you are \"giving a first look to\" in exchange for direct feedback.\n\nAsk them the question: \"What would you need to see to invest?\" Time is your enemy &amp; the VC's friend\u2014as a VC you want to lower you risk, so your incentive is to let time pass so you get more info on the traction &amp; fundraise.\n\nRun a tight process to maximize momentum. Do 20-50 meetings in 2-3 weeks all back-to-back. Be 100% focused on raising. Good ways to get investor referrals:\n\na) introductions from other founders or strong deal sources\nb) introductions from existing investors\n\nBad ways to get investor referrals:\na) introduction from investors who aren\u2019t investing \nb) cold outreach Understand the VC biz model:\n\n\"Out of ten swings at the bat, you get maybe seven strikeouts, two base hits, and if you are lucky, one home run. The base hits and the home runs pay for all the strikeouts.\" \"So logically their investment selection strategy requires a credible\u00a0potential\u00a0of a 10x gain within 4 to 6 years on any individual investment\u2014so that the winners will pay for the losers &amp; in the timeframe\u00a0their\u00a0LPs expect.\"\n\nIf you don't want to 10x in 4-6 yrs, don't raise VC! Parallel track angels &amp; VCs simultaneously.\n\nTell angels if you want that you can secure their allocation if they commit early (or it's more likely), \n\nAsk VCs at the end exactly how their process works. Do your research on the firms &amp; angels. See what else they've invested in.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand their fund size, deal cadence, talk to their founders, you\u2019re not taking it seriously enough.\n\nYou are one of dozens of meetings for them a week. Stand out by doing your homework. During the meeting, don't read your deck to investors. Make it a conversation.\n\nIn the beginning perhaps ask \"Have you invested in the space before?\" to gauge their knowledge.\n\nMidway through the pitch ask \"What's interesting to you about this biz? What's unclear?\" When pitching:\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to consider the biggest reasons an investor might *not* invest, and pre-emptively address those reasons.\n\nIf you\u2019ve solved for them, point to evidence.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, point to how you\u2019ll address them, and the moat you\u2019ve built to date. Ask in the beginning:\n\n\"Do you believe there will be a multi-billion dollar co in the space?\"\n\nIf no \u2014&gt; don\u2019t go further until yes\n\nIf yes \u2014&gt; here's our unfair advantage and why now (instead of 5 yrs ago or 5 yrs from now) When fundraising for a complex co, you might simplify it for investors by saying something like:\n\n\"In order to invest, you'd have to believe that we can execute on X, so that we have Y, which will lead to a multi-billion $ biz.\"\n\nFrame it simply so they can pitch their partners. A founder told me it was reasonable to him that the conversation break down in an founder-to-investor pitch would be 90% founder, 10% investor.\n\nIMO it should be closer to 50/50. The more they talk and ask Qs, the closer they are to getting to a yes. Unconfident fundraisers talk 90% of the time, hammer home hand-wavy talking points, &amp; grasp at straws for what they think VCs wanna hear.\n\nConfident fundraisers listen 50% of the time, ask questions, &amp; admit the risks to investing as well as what they have &amp; haven't proven yet. After pitching, one thing you may try \u2014 under the context of your improvement \u2014 is asking them to role play as if they were pitching your biz to their partnership.\n\nIf they don\u2019t pitch it well, that may tell you something. Conversely, you may like their phrasing better. VCs will say nice things but It's always a no until it's a yes\n\nMost likely nearly all investors will say no but you only need one or a few to say yes.\n\nYou're going to feel like a total failure at it until someone says yes and then you feel like a huge success. You have to maintain a sort of dual awareness: the confidence of someone who's going to raise easily alongside the paranoia of someone who won't (so that you'll prepare like mad)\n\nhttps://t.co/jwjrR1A5rI Every pitch meeting in which you don't consider updating a slide in your deck is a missed opportunity to learn.\n\nhttps://t.co/7315mSEMkJ Other things to think about:\n\nMoney should last to 18-24 months and enable you to reach meaningful milestones\n\nSeed rounds typically result in 15-25% dilution for founders. \n\nKnow whether existing investors are following-on, and how much of the round is already spoken for. Don't recommend setting price at the beginning.\n\n\"We want to work with the best people, so don't want price to be the reason why that wouldn't happen\"\n\n\"We're gonna let the market set the price, but it'll be something reasonable, but ultimately we want to pick the best partner.\" Question to have an answer for:\n\nIf this failed, why? (related to biggest risks)\n\nYou may want to ask the investor that too:\n\nhttps://t.co/ZRyV06cmSf ",

So take your time.\n\nSince you can't compete w/ Google, you want to find ppl that Google isn't chasing after but have even more talent &amp; grit\n\nLike drafting Tom Brady in 6th round What to look for in hires\n\n- High slope &amp; learning velocity\n- Drive &amp; grit\n- Bias to action\n- Micro-pessimist, Macro-optimist:https://t.co/bxOE9PkUgv\n- High integrity &amp; low ego\n- Curious\n- Not only good, but known as good (so they can attract other great ppl)\n- Long-term oriented Before you even start sourcing, make sure you have a good JD &amp; reason why you want to spend $100K-200K hiring someone, b/c this should be last resort.\n\nClearly articulate what success looks like. If they're in the role for 12 months, how do you know that they've been successful? Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for. Treat recruiting like a funnel.\n\nDiagram the entire experience &amp; identify potential leakage.\n\nIf you interview lots of ppl but don't make offers, that's either a poor evaluation process and/or sourcing problem\n\nIf you make offers but don't convert, something's wrong w/ your close Sourcing: \n\n- If you don't have a good enough top of funnel, then you end up compromising at the bottom of the funnel\n\n- Sell managers on the benefits of knowing how to do their own sourcing. (\"If you want to be a leader, you'll have to recruit)\n\n- Throw referral sourcing parties Sourcing:\n\n- Hire in-house recruiter early. Ask sourcers to have 100 targets per wk.\n\n- Like GTM, experiment w/ diff channels &amp; double down\n\n- Spend time w/ ideal passive candidates, recruiting over long time horizon\n\n- Qualify leads (\"Comp expectations? Ideal role &amp; location\"?) Building a interview process:\n\nTreat it like a scientific experiment\u2014You have a control group and you keep the criteria the same.\n\nMake sure that these candidates are asked the same questions in the same order. And you're evaluating them on the same thing so you can compare them. Have a \"scorecard\" that has the attributes you're looking for in the candidate per position, how much they matter, &amp; split up interviews accordingly.\n\nWhatever your hiring process is, codify it, and make sure everyone has access to it.\n\nBefore interviews, have Q's ahead of time. Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Decide too quickly whether they should hire this person or not. That's why it's important to have a checklist\n\n- Pick five qualities that you want to hire for and design questions for every quality. Have interviewers rate 1-5 &amp; compare. Calibrate raters Sample interview Q's:\n\n- If you were me, what kind of candidate would you be looking for?\n- If you joined &amp; then left in 3 months, why would that be?\n- What was your last boss like? How would they describe you?\n\nMore: https://t.co/xb3ov86rI1\n\nNot these ;) https://t.co/TlnuElQQ7k Top grade interview:\n\nPast performance is indicative of future performance, so dig in.\n\nGo through last 5 jobs &amp; ask:\n\n\"What were your accomplishments? Struggles? Who did you work closely w/ &amp; how would they rate the candidate from 1-10, in your opinion?\"\n\nThen reference. Reference philosophy:\n\n- On &amp; off-book references.\n\n- Decrease defensiveness to get better answers. Start by saying \"We really like X and we'd be excited to work w/ them. Curious to ask Q's to best set them up for success.\"\n\n- Do video to see body language. Q's to ask references:\n\n- How do they react to frustration?\n\n- What would that person's critic say? or last performance review?\n\n- Describe the ideal role?\n\n- Is this top 5% ppl you've worked w/? or Rate 1-10 but no 7.\n\n- If this didn't work out, why not?\n\nhttps://t.co/VvDjCR2hp9 When referencing:\n\n- Sell the reference giver on why it's such an amazing opportunity!\n\n- Ask them for referrals for other great ppl that should join\n\n- Consider recruiting them if they are a fit &amp; seem interested!\n\n- Close the loop when you make them an offer. Make them an ally. Mistakes founders make: not optimizing candidate experience.\n\nWhen you interview the candidate, the candidate is selling you. But you should also be selling them\n\nNot only does that help you close the ppl you want to hire, but actually creates like word of mouth effect for others How to give a great candidate experience\n\n- Clear expectations of role across team\n- Consistent communication\n- Transparent &amp; sensible process\n- Social time w/ the team\n- Respect their time, particularly w/ take home work\n- Make them feel special, not a cog\n- Quality interviews Closing candidates:\n\nIf you're unable to close candidates, then all else is meaningless.\n\nIt's also demoralizing to existing employees who interview the candidates (\"If they don't want to work here, why am I?\"\n\nSell the mission, the team, &amp; the opportunity. Make it compelling. Closing:\n\n- Aim for ~70% close rate.\n\n- Only make an offer when you're sure they'll accept. (\"If we give you X,Y, Z, would you accept?\")\n\n- Identify who influences their decision and take them out to dinner w/ candidate (spouse? peer?)\n\n- Enlist reference as an ally in closing. Closing:\n\nHave the investor sell the candidate on why they invested, why it'll be an enormous outcome, &amp; how they think about the team from an \"unbiased\" POV, and how the investor likes to invest in their employees future career success (perhaps even back their eventual startup)! Closing:\n\n- Q4 is best time to recruit. Holidays are reflective, post Q4 bonus, ppl are most ready to jump\n\n- Weather also helps. NYC kid comes in winter to SF &amp; sees sunshine...\n\n- 4 yr vest is natural, but don't be shy 1 mo after ppl join new co, in case it wasn't the right fit Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Not allocating enough time to recruiting, esp. passive candidates.\n\n- CEOs think they have to build, but after they raise money their job is to hire people who can build.\n\n- Over 50% of founder's time should be spent hiring. They rarely spend enough. A hire isn't truly a hire until they've completed 90 day plan.\n\nHave them write 1st draft of their annual review and co-define what success looks like, then back into a 90 day plan (which should have been backed into from the job description)\n\nIf after 90 days not good, can cut. Double down on your stars &amp; promote within\n\nIf you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is more important than trying to fix ppl who won't create 10x value.\n\nManagement drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employees Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Hiring too senior, too soon, when they try to do big co things in a small co setting.\n\n- Hiring too senior too late is also bad b/c you got builders but you don't know what you should be building &amp; how to scale &amp; implement processes Mistake people make when hiring head of recruiting:\n\nHiring someone from FB/Google and expecting same output.\n\nFind me someone who can sell a company with no brand and less pay.\n\nEasy to sell ice cream. Hard to tell a cold hot dog.\n\nWhen hiring one, make sure they can source too. Sell a cold hot dog* When to hire a head of HR?\n\nWhen founders are spending more than 20% of their time on HR issues, then it's time to bring in a head of HR. No one cares like founders care. \n\nNo one's gonna personalize emails or sell in person like the founders will. \n\nNo one\u2019s gonna have credibility like founder does.\n\nIf you're CEO, own the function initially, while building out a process so it can eventually scale beyond you.

  "text": "Byrne Hobart is one of the most interesting &amp; wide-ranging writers out there right now\n\nHere's a thread of some of his ideas on globalization, financial bubbles, social capital &amp; more\n\nHis old work here: https://t.co/uYSfQ3gbcS\n\nSign up for new work here: https://t.co/CownITPNMe A lot of productivity growth is historically contingent.\n\nFor Manhattan project to happen, you needed:\n\n- U.S. out the war but still paranoid about it\n- European intellectuals fleeing Europe for U.S.\n- People to realize this was important and could be done.\n\nHard to plan for. Globalization is both a compliment and substitute for Productivity growth.\n\nCompliment: Economies of scale. Important for any good w/ high fixed cost and low marginal cost (software)\n\nSubstitute: Opportunity cost for innovating vs copying what's already worked elsewhere goes up Globalization w/o tech breakthrough makes sense on a micro level but breaks down on macro level.\n\nIf you look at US cars per capita and extrapolate to India, that can work for India. But if you extrapolate everywhere, oil will cost $300 a barrel and we'll have a global depression The future effects of technology are hard to predict:\n\nWhen the transistor came out, people thought they'd be good for hearing aids. Why has science slowed?\n\nMany scientists had their breakthroughs in 20s.\n\nThe more advanced the state of the art is in any given field, the more of your time you have to spend just getting caught up\u2014&amp; thus you miss being able to contribute in what some ppl call your peak years. As population skews older, you have fewer people in the workforce and more people needing healthcare.\n\nOlder people are also more likely to vote (2 to 1), so politicians cater to their needs. US deficit in oil production was basically tying the global economy together.\n\nHad to keep Middle East stable, which meant had to keep everyone else stable too. US dependency on Middle East for oil was an implicit subsidy for the East Asian export driven economic success stories. Now that we are energy independent, doesn't make sense for us to intervene as much for oil.\n\nBut intervening might make sense to ensure the world is on our currency system, in our supply chains and in our cultural sphere.\n\nWar for oil was never popular. War for P&amp;G even less. What can we learn from east asian miracles?\n\nU.S. shouldn't copy blindly everything that they do anymore than they copied everything the U.S. did.\n\nBut they do prove state directed model can work, if competent.\n\nLesson: Make it high status to be in gov't so great ppl go there. Quoting someone else:\n\n\"There's only one thing worse than working than living under incompetent &amp; corrupt gov't. And that's living under an incompetent &amp; thoroughly honest gov't b/c at least in the 1st scenario, you can pay someone to let you do what you need to do.\" One reason why trade deficit doesn't matter as much:\n\nSince U.S. is a great place to invest in b/c of human capital, Maybe U.S. should be running a deficit because it's still the best place to put money, whether it's safe money in treasuries or risk capital in startups. China might be vulnerable:\n\nCCP derives political legitimacy from the fact that the economy is growing\n\nWhen U.S. struggles, they switch the president, but don't question democracy\n\nIf China had their own 2008, unclear it'd be the same. Propaganda campaign underway to make it so Mental model of Trump:\n\nDespite many flaws, he's good at evaluating (&amp; memeifying) the weakness of others.\n\nIn real estate, he didn't buy a good area and improve it, he buys a disaster area &amp; makes sure lenders are more scared of him defaulting than he is.\n\nIt's a strategy. Charter Cities:\n\nGeography, demographics, resources, &amp; culture matter. \n\nDon't try to build these top down systems that can apply everywhere, instead adapt to local circumstances.\n\nYou can't just say if this country had U.S. institutions, it'd have U.S. GDP per capita. Charter Cities: \n\nUnlike startups, you have to worry that incumbents will literally kill you if you threaten them.\n\nYour best case scenario is the Bin Laden option where you have this extremely depressing life where you're waiting to get killed\u2014&amp; then you get killed. Be careful. Anti-tech in some sense is bi-partisan.\n\nLeft says we're concerned that people might not be getting ideas from approved sources.\n\nRight says we're don't like these techies doing drugs at Burning Man.\n\nBoth worry about 7 yr olds w/ smart phone addictions.\n\n(Caricatures of views) Response to tech-lash? \n\nCompanies get less ambitious.\n\nMicrosoft got less ambitious after anti-trust, which is partly why it missed mobile but also is least threatening of all tech giants. \n\nThe monopolies always pretend to not be monopolies. Malthus was actually correct that higher crop yields did lead to faster birth rates.\n\nWhat he didn't foresee was that the shift from manual labor to producing food led to longer career investment &amp; thus people delaying getting married until they're older (&amp; thus having less kids) Progressives &amp; Conservatives are confused.\n\nProgressives have adopted conservative puritan view that man is intrinsically sinful &amp; should subvert himself to the not sinful.\n\nConservatives have adopted progressive view that good institutions can change ppl (e.g democracy in Iraq). Progress studies itself is fundamentally agnostic. \n\nJust focused on increasing productivity, rather than asking who wins, who loses.\n\nIt's anti-partisan in the sense that partisanship tends to arise when we become less productive, that's when politics becomes more zero sum. Why we're polarized (besides slow growth)\n\nInternet means more news outlets that appeal to niche interests.\n\nSocial media means it's easy to get the propaganda you want.\n\nYou can choose media outlets that are going to outrage you in the precise way you want to be outraged. Peak California:\n\nHousing shortage means rents go up in line w/ cash comp, not equity comp, &amp; that means that incumbents have a recruiting advantage over startups.\n\nIn other words, high real estate selects against early stage companies &amp; selects for later stage companies. Stanford boiled down is an acceptance letter, a network, and a job fair at the end.\n\nYC realized you could do this in 3 months instead of 4 years\u2014and that equity was a better business model.\n\nLike Stanford, the more it succeeds, the more it becomes a monoculture. What Pinker gets wrong:\n\nThe distribution of extreme violence is such that the trailing mean is always lower than the the actual underlying mean.\n\nHe's correct about what a linear extrapolation from the historic data tells you, but wrong about the nature of that distribution. Darwinian case for monogamy:\n\nIncreases the chances that you'll be loyal to each other &amp; dedicated to their kids\u2014who are then more likely to do the same for their kids.\n\nCounter argument is that a lot of artistic and intellectual achievement doesn't come from normie families Austrian economics:\n\nBoom &amp; bust cycles don't just happen in gov't, but also in private business.\n\nThey tend to predict bubbles too early and that's why you'll tend to make more money betting on the bubble &amp; going along for the ride Lessons from Alan Greenspan:\n\nIf you want to positively impact the world, you can either have great ideas or do whatever it takes to implement them.\n\nSomeone has to do the latter, dirty work. What's the point of having brilliant theorists whose theories never get implemented? Ideal education:\n\nKids should find a topic they're passionate about, dive into it in as much depth as possible, just nerd out to the maximum extent possible, &amp; then find something else wants once they've either reached the limit of their abilities or their interest has waned Online filter bubbles are bad, but real world filter bubbles can be good.\n\nThey can be safe spaces for people who have heretical ideas to mold them until they're ready to be shared.\n\nSafe spaces for people who don't want to be merely mimetic. Equality\n\nWealth gets more unequal, but consumption gets more equal (which is why the gap btw a billionaire's life and our lives is smaller than it used to be). \n\nOvertime, wealthy end up w/ larger share of country's resources, until a war or plague and that all gets wiped out. Role of gov't &amp; wall street: \n\nCoordinate behavior at scale to pursue a distant objective.\n\nThey both coordinate a lot of behavior that is optimal when it happens in parallel, but not that useful if it happens in sequence. (E.g Apollo) Bubbles happen when some people say the price is too high, others are saying no it\u2019s early ppl will make so much money (e.g internet bubble dot com optimists were actually right).\n\nBut the ones who got optimistic at the wrong time lost a lot of money. Equity bubble\u2014The future will be very different from the present &amp; you want to own equity in that future. We all try to be different\n\nCredit bubble\u2014future will look exactly like the past only more. Ppl who owe us money will continue to service the debt. We all try to be the same Nepotism is a credit market for reputation rather than cash.\n\nLike financial banks, there are social capital \"banks\" willing to lend social capital to ppl who don't need it and not willing to risk social capital on new &amp; risky people\n\nNeed to incentivize social capital investing Social capital bubbles:\n\nIf there are just more people willing to vouch for more people, then you end up with too many bad ideas getting funded.\n\nAnd you also end up with people optimizing for getting recommended versus optimizing for building something good Social capital isn't like the economy where you can tinker w/ interest rates &amp; inflation.\n\nSo in that sense of status market is maybe analogous to the gold standard where there can be inflation and deflation and they're actually somewhat exoticness to the system My conversations w/ @ByrneHobart here:\n\nhttps://t.co/OP95Sbokvq\n\nhttps://t.co/qcDHNenO56\n\nSign up here to read more.

  "text": "Some thoughts on finding product/market fit, from @rahulvohra.\n\nRead his full piece here: https://t.co/FG99BPbBfR How to define PM-fit?\n\nPG says \"It's when you made something people want\"\n\n@sama says \"When users love your product so much that they spontaneously tell other people to start using it without you even asking them to do that.\"\n\nPG\u2019s is around desire, Sam's is around distribution Pmarca says:\n\n\"Number one, you can always feel it when product/market fit is not happening. Customers aren't quite getting value, users are not growing quite that fast, word of mouth is not spreading, press who use it are a kind of blah, and the sales cycle takes too damn long.\" Andreessen continued:\n\nBut you can always feel it when product market fit is happening. Customers are buying as fast as you can add servers, you're hiring sales and support as fast as you can, ...money is piling up in your checking account, investors are staking out your house... Andreessen continued:\n\nDo whatever is required to get to PM-fit Including changing out ppl, rewriting product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don't want to, telling customers yes when you don't want to, raising that 4th round of dilutive VC\u2014Anything Andreessen continued:\n\nConversely, you see a surprising # of really well-run cos having all aspects of operations completely buttoned down, HR policies in place, great sales model, ... outstanding catered food, top tier VCs, heading straight off a cliff due to not finding PM-fit These are all great, but they're lagging indicators.\n\nSean Ellis found a leading indicator\u2014measure how many users would be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product.\n\nCompanies w/ over 40% often grow easily. Opposite for under.\n\nIf you have 40%, invest in growth. Survey: \n\n1/ What is it that ppl love about X?\n\n2/ What holds ppl back from falling in love w/ X?\n\nIf they love product for same reason, just find more of that user.\n\nSpend 1/2 time doubling down on what users already love about X &amp; other 1/2 on what\u2019s holding others back If you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score won\u2019t increase. \n\nIf you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you. \n\nThis insight can guide your product planning process, effectively writing your roadmap for you. Roadmap:\n\nTo stack-rank priorities, use a simple cost-impact analysis: label each potential project as low/medium/high cost, and similarly low/medium/high impact.\n\nImpact from solving held ppl back is clear from survey.\n\nImpact from doubling down on strengths is more intuitive Highest Expectation Customer (HEC):\n\nPpl who enjoy your product for its greatest benefit\n\nNo massive consumer internet brand has ever grown primarily through viral loops or viral mechanics\n\nThey also always have virality through word of mouth\n\nWhich is why HEC's are so important. Recap: \n\n1/ How would you feel if you couldn't use X? (very, somewhat, or not disappointed)\n\n2/ What ppl would benefit most from X?\n\n3/ What's main benefit you get from X?\n\n4/ How can we improve X?\n\nSend survey to ppl who've used X at least 2x in 2 weeks. ~40 responses is enough SABR:\n\n1- Segment to find supporters &amp; paint a picture of your high-expectation customers (very disappointed)\n\n2- Analyze feedback to convert on-the-fence users into fans\n\n3- Build your roadmap by doubling down on what users love and addressing what holds others back\n\n4- Repeat Ignore customers who either\n\n- wouldn't be \"very disappointed\" if X went away AND/OR\n\n- don't experience the main benefit as your high-expectation customer\n\nDo cater to the needs of customers who would be very disappointed and/or the ones who share the main benefit as your HEC. Ignoring the \"somewhat disappointed\" will be hard.\n\nThey\u2019ll request distracting features, present ill-fitting use cases &amp; be very vocal, all before they churn out and leave you with a mangled, muddled roadmap\n\nActing on their feedback will lead you astray on your quest for PM-fit Making sure you pick the right customers (&amp; keep the wrong ones out) is *critical*\n\nBy focusing on the right customers, you get more relevant feedback, you learn faster, you increase NPS, you get more word-of-mouth virality, with the community that matters most to you. PM-fit measures dependency on a product, either because there's such a strong emotional connection or because nothing else exists quite like it.\n\nNPS score measures how strong your word of mouth effect is likely to be in others.\n\nYou need both, but figure out PM-fit first. Metrics:\n\nYou don't want your churn to be more than 6-7% month to month or you're going to have a very hard time building meaningful business. \n\nFor a single player subscription tool, 2-3% month to month is great Is this a full proof plan to PM-fit? Not exactly.\n\n3 reasons why companies may fail even w/ PM-fit engine:\n\n1- Running out of money before they finish this process. \n\n2- Co-founders breaking up.\n\n3- Giving up. \n\nIf PM-fit score is 5-15%, Rahul recommends reconsidering the product Pricing: \n\n1- Understand competitive environment. \n\n2- Come up w/ positioning \n\n3- Develop pricing \n\nAsk your target users four questions:\n\n1- At what $ would you consider X to be so expensive that you wouldn't consider buying it? Pricing: \n\n2- At what price would you consider X to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn't be very good? \n\n3- At what price would you consider X to be getting expensive? \n\n4- At what price is X a bargain?\n\nOnly lower price if land-grab or 1st-mover advantage On launching:\n\nReid Hoffman: \"If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.\"\n\nThis applies to startups creating new markets, esp w/ network effects (LinkedIn, Airbnb)\n\nIn existing markets w/ great products, bar is different (E.g Notion) On launch:\n\n\u201cA startup should only launch for one of three reasons: \n\n1- You need more users or customers to sell to. \n\n2- You need more capital to spend. \n\n3- You need more candidates to hire.\u201d /FIN\n\nI also recorded a podcast w/ @rahulvohra and @toddg777 about their new angel fund, and other company-building topics.\n\nhttps://t.co/lypbaW3g5t ",

Compliance requirements also expensive:\n\n75% of IT budget goes towards maintaining existing products\n\n15% of work force is devoted solely to compliance. (e.g. manually reviewing alerts triggered by anti-money laundering (AML) systems and filing suspicious activity reports.) So why not disrupt &amp; start competing banks? \n\n- To comply w/ regulation, need to partner w/ existing bank partner who \"lends\" their license\n\n- Hard for bank to partner b/c needs to ensure startup complying w/ KYC, AML, etc\n\n- Also need card issuer, processor, printer, etc What's changed?\n\nAWS moment for banks\n\nAWS dramatically lowered cost of launching tech company; \"Infrastructure as a service\" companies will do the same for fin-tech. \n\nWhat AWS did for compute &amp; storage, fin-tech companies will provide elements of the banking stack as a service.

I joke that reactions post-podcasts are similar to reactions post-sex in some ways.\n\nAfterwards everyone's like: \n\n\"How'd I do?\" \n\n\"Was that good for you?\" \n\n\"Did I talk too much?\" \u201cWhy was it so awkward?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh nice, you bought equipment!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we not announce this for a few months?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t go well, can we just pretend it never happened? Ease the guest by telling them they get final edit, that your goal is to make them look great, and that, despite the prep, your conversation should be casual as if you were chatting over a drink.\n\nIf they are eager to promote their stuff, get it out of the way in the beginning. Instead of yes/no questions, ask open-ended &amp; double questions (\u201cwhat do you believe about X and how has that evolved overtime/what does that mean for\u2026\u201d)\n\nAs a podcast guest, view Q's less as specific Q's to be answered and more as prompts to say whatever's most interesting. Other tips:\n\n- Focus on a topic you have expertise in, no matter how niche\n\n- Try to have high-signal guests that haven't done podcasts before. (e.g Byrne Hobart)\n\n- If you have a famous guest, try to ask them questions they haven't answered before: https://t.co/fzQosoAZgK Set expectations with your listeners by being consistent:\n\n- Release cadence (frequency, timing)\n\n- Topic\n\n- Episode length\n\nReduce friction by giving your audience a clear picture of what to expect. Do this by example. \n\n20 min VC is a master here. Qs I like:\n\nWhen you look back on the arc of your career, what's the thread that ties everything together? What threads have you kept pulling?\n\nWhen you look forward on what you aim to achieve in the decades to come, what do you want your eventual wikipedia page to say? Other broad Q's to ask:\n\nWhat are the major camps in your field? \nMajor debates? Where do you stand on them? \nWhat would need to be true for you to believe the other side? \nWhat have you changed your mind on?\nHow has your field evolved over time? What were the different waves? Bring up controversial points (or questions they can't answer directly) by using the passive voice.\n\n\"Some people say X\"\n\n\"How would you respond to the critique that...\"\n\n\"Hypothetically, if someone were to say someone like you should do this, what would you recommend to them?\" When podcasting, one of my favorite feelings is asking a Q + then figuring out on the fly what the next Q will be, jostling a few different variations while also listening &amp; being open to going in a totally different direction\n\nPodcasts as real-time conversational chess Why should you start a podcast?\n\n- It's forcing function to learn enough about a topic so that you don't feel dumb talking to an expert about it in public\n\n- It's a way to make new friends or strengthen old friendships (with guests &amp; listeners)\n\n- Traces how your thinking evolves For podcast guests: Think of the Q's as prompts to say the most insightful thing you can say.\n\nDon't focus on pleasantries, politeness, or even answering the exact Q if you don't have a good answer.\n\nA podcast is a dance. The host will suggest, but you take it where you wanna go. ",

  "text": "Some of my favorite takeaways from Samo Burja's \"Great Founder Theory\" &amp; other writings: Thread \ud83d\udc47\n\nGreat Founder Theory: https://t.co/THdfyDdeHg\n\nOther writing: https://t.co/UVMU3RkrDT Diff theories of history:\n\nGreat man theory looks at history through the lens of the individuals who shaped it.\n\nTechnological determinism explain events in terms of the technologies that enabled them.\n\nProgressivism looks at history through the lens of increasing social justice. Functional institutions are the exception, not the norm.\n\nSociety flourishes by having functional institutions\n\nGreat Founder Theory focuses on how great founders create (or rebuild) functional institutions that enable (sustained) flourishing A functional institution can outright solve a problem for a civilization. \n\nIt might, for example, complete the construction of infrastructure so important it changes the course of economic development for centuries to come, such as ancient China\u2019s grand canal or...solving COVID. \"Like many things, people\u2019s impact on the world follows a Pareto-like distribution, with the most impactful people having a far greater impact than the rest.\n\nThe creation of functional institutions is the means by which people are hugely impactful.\" It's easier to start from scratch than to rebuild from within.\n\nInstitutions often resist change, and diagnosing dysfunction is hard, as it usually has many causes\n\nThis explains Thiel\u2019s law: a founder\u2019s best shot at creating a functional institution is to get it from the start. Live &amp; Dead players:\n\nA live player is a person or a tightly coordinated group of people that is able to innovate (startup mentality).\n\nA dead player is a person or a group of people that is working off a script, incapable of doing new things. (incumbent mentality) Understanding a player is dead means you can replace them without much of a fight.\n\nUnderstanding a player is live means you can collaborate with them and you should be mindful of their path to power\n\nTo revive a dead player, you have to displace an existing power structure What happens to institution when great founder dies?\n\nSuccession challenge.\n\nPower succession: Who takes over\n\nSkill succession: How do they gain the skills.\n\nRome solved this by \"adopting\" someone early and ensuring their training If the succession problem is unsolved, the only process of institutional reform is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as creative destruction.\n\nThat we praise this process indicates we've resigned ourselves to failed succession. We should temper our enthusiasm for intense political and economic competition and instead develop a greater appreciation for the importance of successful succession. \n\nThis change would go far in remedying contemporary institutional sclerosis and stagnation. The purpose of a bureaucracy is to save the time of a competent person.\n\nPut another way: to save time, some competent people will create a system that is meant to do exactly what they want \u2014 nothing more and nothing less Create a bureaucracy when you are both \n\n(a) trying to do something that you do not have the capacity to do on your own, and \n\n(b) unable to find a competent, aligned person to handle the project for you. \n\nBureaucracies ameliorate the problem of talent and alignment scarcity. Bureaucrats are expected to act according to a script, or a set of procedures \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\n\nOwners don\u2019t trust that bureaucrats will be competent or aligned enough to act in line with the owner\u2019s wishes of their own accord.\n\nIf low trust, minimize downside (&amp; thus cap upside) Other methods of accomplishing goals:\n\nIf you have access to a delegate (i.e someone you trust), don\u2019t treat them like a bureaucrat. \n\nA delegate can perform tasks you didn\u2019t know needed doing and build aligned systems beyond your design, a bureaucrat cannot. Status is a coordination mechanism\u2014the relative respect &amp; patterns of deference accorded to people, groups &amp; organizations by wider society.\n\nDispersing it wisely decreases friction for certain high impact people to team up and work on certain high impact projects (&amp; vice versa). Celebration of such people isn\u2019t merely a personal reward. \n\nIt is how we replenish this social capital, which in turn powers the social fabric that enables these people to do what they do. \n\nWithout it, you can\u2019t go to space. (e.g. Elon helping make space cool &amp; feasible) Dispersing status is one of the most important roles of the ruler\u2014\n\nThe ruler uses his prestige to regulate overall status, so that the right people &amp; the right behaviors win, solving coordination problems &amp; tragedies of the commons.\n\nGlory is a better motivator than money. intellectual dark matter: knowledge we cannot see publicly, but whose existence we can infer because our institutions would fly apart if the knowledge we see were all there was.\n\nThe danger of copying:\n\nOnce a tradition is lost, you are making photocopies of photocopies. Each subsequent copy loses information. \n\nA crucial difference between organisms &amp; organizations is that organizations do not undergo natural selection. \n\nSince the fidelity of transmitting intricate social technologies is so low, complex adaptations cannot arise. Lost knowledge: Just as physicists are only able to observe 15% of matter in existence, today we possess written fragments from only 13% of the ~2,000 known ancient Greek \n\nMuch of our foundational knowledge was built on that ~13% Imagine how much we'd have if we'd found more? Tacit knowledge is knowledge that's not transmitted in writing. \n\ne.g. a blacksmith learns to craft well-balanced swords through direct practice and correction from a master \u2014 not by reading a textbook.\n\nMy 4/1 assist to turnover ratio in pick up b-ball\u2014you can't teach that. YouTube enables the teaching of tacit knowledge at scale unlike anything before.\n\nWithout YT, much tactic knowledge turned into intellectual dark matter.\n\nYT searches in the \u201chow-to\u201d category have grown 70% year-on-year.\n\nPerhaps as influential as printing press or telegraph. Samo's YouTube content is also great: https://t.co/7JhnlXVc9h\n\nDid a couple podcasts w/ him:\n\nhttps://t.co/8VDZeY9kg3\n\nhttps://t.co/eFR7SL4Pwg ",

How?\" \n\nIt was used to protect the market from gov't social engineering\u2014now it's used to justify it.\n\nTime to find a new word. It's been co-opted. To be sure, it was always tricky (read: impossible) to discern talent from effort from parents and social class and environment\n\nTo unbundle what's in your control (merit) from what isn't (circumstance)\n\nWhich leads to irresolvable conflict over who's the \"best\" &amp; who \"earns\" it Conflict such as:\n\n\"They earned it!

Not a true meritocracy b/c it was never a fair race to begin with.

We believed the market was a fairer process than gov't selection.\n\nNow ppl think the opposite. If you win in the market, it's prob b/c you didn't earn it.

Diff btw underwriting &amp; rating:\n\nUnderwriting is essentially a yes/no decision of whether or not to insure the risk. \n\nIf the answer is affirmative, I will underwrite this risk, then you rate the risk, which is looking at the risk and figure out what price to charge.

Deceiving others (&amp; ourselves) often helps.\n\nhttps://t.co/gPwUk0KQhZ Sure, our main main goals are survival and reproduction. \n\nBut those things depend on being high status.\n\nWhy? \n\nHaving a good reputation is the best way to get people to work with you, take care of you, &amp; date you\n\nWhat is culture? The defaults behaviors that raise your status How does status work?\n\nImagine that we all have a number floating above our heads.\n\nThat's our status score. \n\nWe can't see it, but we all kind of know where we rank (dating apps sure do)\n\nOur brain works over time to perceive this in ourselves and others (in diff contexts too) Status is scarce\n\nSo people compete for it. Often violently.\n\nBut we also have to work together, so we've evolved to jockey for status without resorting to violence.\n\nHow? Signalling\n\nSignalling saves you from violence, but it means you're effectively BS-ing your way through life A good way of getting your way is using any means necessary to convince others, even deceiving.\n\nThis means you're often looking out for others deceiving you.\n\nThe best way to deceive is to not lie.\n\nBelieve your own bullshit so deeply that you don\u2019t produce any sign of cheating. What does this mean?\n\nTruth does not matter when you try to arrange a society. \n\nNot only it does not matter; it's harmful.\n\nYou basically can\u2019t have a functional &amp; long-standing society if the truth is widely known.\n\nWhy would truth be helpful anyway?\n\nhttps://t.co/nTEmneXBaD Unless truth raises our social status, we don't care. We don't even filter for it\u2014Not even on our radar\n\nThe true logic of emotions? Whatever helps us survive, reproduce (get status)\u2014at least 10,000 yr ago\n\nWhat does deception look like? Parroting high status opinions w/ no logic Thankfully we've evolved the perfect equipment (e.g. consciousness) over many years to deceive others by deceiving ourselves\n\nLanguage is a tool to make up excuses to raise your status. That's more or less it\n\nIt's not a receptacle for or the origin of your thoughts, it's a tool. Truth is hard.\n\nNot only are you deceiving yourself all the time to raise your status, but other people are also deceiving you all the time  to raise theirs too.\n\nSo of course being able to manipulate your peers is more important than being able to correctly understand truth. People\u2019s statements are just signals in a long-standing status competition.\n\nKevin Simler and Robin Hanson wrote an entire book on this: https://t.co/NpLkkJw7mA\n\nConflict theory &amp; mistake theory get at two ways to address this: https://t.co/Lc9Z5CMWoc To be sure, Some people do get status from pursuing truth (scientists, writers, academics)\n\nThe more truth they pursue, the more status they get, b/c they're great at it.\n\nBut most people aren't good enough to gain any status from truth-discovery, so they refrain from pursuing it Why would we be evolved for truth?\n\nIt takes time and effort, and it's not necessary\n\nTruth is often inconvenient for status\n\nIt's more effective to believe self-serving BS\n\nChange the rules of the game. When they go truth, you go BS\n\nWhatever you gotta do to survive &amp; reproduce. People will believe whatever gives them shortest path to social status.\n\nBut you may have noticed that people's actions don't match their beliefs.\n\nFor example, public schools for all, but best teachers for your kids.\n\n\"Egalitarianism when being selected, Elitism when selecting\". People get depressed hearing this, but the deception is not all bad; sometimes you want to hide things.\n\nThe whole concept of \"status\" altogether is a problematic truth, which is why we rarely acknowledge it explicitly and certainly resist making it legible to the internet.\n\nWhy? Genetical survival is often zero-sum, and even when it isn't, competition for mates is zero-sum.\n\nThis is a hard truth to coordinate around (that humans are inherently in conflict) \n\nSo we hide the idea of status &amp; pursue it secretly &amp; subconsciously, deceiving all along the way. So back to people's beliefs\n\nPeople will usually believe whatever improves their short-term status, whatever wins them approval from those they care about\n\n(Pick your role models carefully!)\n\nThe vast majority of ideas don\u2019t have short-term physical consequences; just social ones This is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. \n\nDifferent ideas suit different people at different times\n\nIdeas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas. Which is why the culture war is so existential.\n\nBecause the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school cafeteria politics\n\nBecause people are just vessels, looking for a hit. They don\u2019t really care where they get it, only that it\u2019s good. Our understanding of the mind still assumes that people have \"ideas\" in their head and that \"reason\" determines how they behave.\n\nDoesn't take status into account.\n\nIt's like the Christian emphasis on \u201cfaith\u201d, i.e that some people have \u201cfaith\u201d, which makes them more noble people. Sometimes the logic gap is so strong that we know we are being deceptive.\n\nThis is what preference falsification is: People holding in their views b/c they're not socially safe.\n\nPpl are just trying to get by. Survive &amp; reproduce.\n\n**\nInterested in hearing feedback on these ideas In conclusion:\n\n- Status drives behaviors (&amp; beliefs)\n\n- People only pursue (or even perceive) truth when it aligns with an increase in their status\n\n- As such, we've evolved to deceive others &amp; deceive ourselves so we can do that most effectively\n\nSo: Be https://t.co/IpH4Z3Deb3 ",

  "text": "What should Fed monetary policy be in response to COVID-19, particularly if it becomes a global financial crisis?\n\nMostly summarizing/quoting this podcast episode: https://t.co/ZXkTFhof1p\n\nBuilding off this thread, which gives some historical context: https://t.co/byu4q3u2IB COVID-19 was initially a supply shock (e.g supply chains)\n\nWhat markets are really worried about is a demand shock. \n\nThis negative supply shock is probably reducing expected growth in the global economy, and that's putting downward pressure on the equilibrium interest rate If the Fed doesn't reduce interest rates along w/ a fall in the equilibrium rate, then monetary policy will get unintentionally tighter, &amp; that reduces aggregate demand\n\nIt's incorrect to say the Fed should just stand pat &amp; not adjust interest rates b/c it's a supply side problem And it's not correct to say that monetary policy can solve supply side problems either.\n\nThis supply side problem could then trigger a change in aggregate demand and monetary policy needs to adjust to prevent that secondary effect on aggregate demand. (e.g housing in 2008) The initial supply shock is similar to trade war last year.\n\nWhen there's a disruption to manufacturing supply chains, that tends to reduce business investment, which puts downward pressure on demand for credit, which (usually) reduces equilibrium interest rates. Also, w/ COVID, there's also a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. \n\nAnd when there's uncertainty, there's a rush for safe assets, people buy treasury bonds, that also puts downward pressure on interest rates. \n\nSo you have this downward pressure on global interest rates. You can think of the equilibrium rate as the rate consistent w/ stable economic growth &amp; consistent w/ the feds targets for inflation &amp; employment.\n\nIf the Fed sets its policy rate too high or too low, we go off track\n\nThis makes ppl think Fed should do nothing, but it's untrue Doing nothing is doing something\n\nIf you want money supply or interest rates to be the same as before, you have to do something to get it there\n\nif velocity slows, to maintain the same monetary policy, you have to increase money supply to offset effects on declining velocity B/c the dollar plays a large role in the global economy, changes in US monetary policy have ripple effects on other countries.\n\nIf Fed doesn't cut rates fast enough, monetary policy gets unintentionally tighter. Side effect of tighter money is the dollar appreciates in fx market. This also happened in the second half of 2008 during the financial crisis:\n\nThe dollar appreciated strongly, and for countries where their currencies are linked to the dollar &amp; that have borrowed a lot of money in dollars, this can become a very big burden. What should Fed do if it becomes a global financial crisis?\n\nTactics:\n\nIn 2008, the Fed extended a number of currency swap lines to a number of central banks across the world. Prob same again\n\nCutting interest rates, QE to address immediate crisis for liquidity, need for stimulus Strategy:\n\nGDP level targeting, but that's unrealistic, so instead level targeting of inflation. \n\nLevel targeting, as opposed to just inflation targeting, forces Fed to be much more serious.\n\nIf Fed overestimates inflation, they actually have to make up for past mistakes Many central banks have had excessively contractionary monetary policy, which has led to inflation &amp; growth not hitting their target.\n\nLow inflation &amp; low growth puts pressure on interest rates\n\nAs interest rates fall, ppl think central banks have easy monetary policy. Which is why people think there aren't many levers for monetary policy. But that's wrong. These low interest rates (&amp; QE) are really a reflection of previous tight money\n\nWe have to ask ourselves two questions: 1/ what kind of target do we want for inflation or nominal GDP growth? \n\nThe higher the target, the higher the interest rate, &amp; the less QE you'll have to do, b/c ppl won't want to hold as much cash\n\nWant low inflation rate? (e.g. Japan, Switzerland) Do QE b/c ppl will hoard cash 2/ Are we going to tell central banks to do whatever it takes to hit their inflation / growth targets?\n\nOr would we rather give this to fiscal policy?\n\nMonetary policy is less costly b/c it neither adds to our national debt nor puts a big tax burden on future generations Also less costly than fiscal policy b/c if the Fed buys a lot of assets, usually it will make a profit (they did in 2008)\n\nBut even if they make a modest loss, that loss is going to be a much smaller burden on future taxpayers than fiscal stimulus would be Maybe there's a chance that, if interest rates fell to zero and they couldn't be cut any further, they Fed could widen the range of assets (e.g. Treasury securities, corporate bonds) they could buy wide enough such that they'd have enough assets to hit a 2% inflation target. We keep seesawing but each time is better than before.\n\nOverreacted on expansionary side in 60s/70s\n\nIn last decade, overreacted on contractionary side\n\nBut 2008 was much better recovery than 1929.\n\nFed should be more responsive to market conditions than Phillips Curve models In conclusion: Desired response is level targeting, ideally of GDP but inflation level targeting will do.\n\nAdditionally, Fed should cut interest rate target b/c I believe equilibrium interest rate has fallen, but cutting interest rates without level targeting isn't enough.

Most people aren't Bill Gates or Zuck\n\nFrom financial POV, study something technical from a great school\n\nEngineering degrees do well at all schools. Humanities only do real well at top schools Is this a ponzi scheme?\n\nWe have a federal loan program funded by the taxpayer such that students can go into debt &amp; then keep paying, via taxes to fund other people's debt. \n\nBoth K-12 and higher-ed are monopolies. Monopolies don't care to improve b/c they don't have to. They shouldn't be called public schools. They should be called gov't schools.\n\nWould you feel good eating gov't sushi? or driving the official gov't built car designed by the DMV?\n\nIf we don't do the above, why do we expect gov't to make schools w/ better results than sushi/cars? The great myth is that we've slashed funding for public education in the US over last 40 years. We've tripled it in terms of cost per student.\n\nAnd results have been flat. Massive price increase, no quality decrease\n\nWith colleges, gov'ts don't own them, but it's an oligopoly How is it a cartel?\n\nAccreditation is a rigged process that keeps out competitors (last entrance into top 10 was Stanford over 100 years ago).\n\nNon-accredited universities don't benefit from tax breaks and federal subsidies &amp; loans so it's hard to compete. From tax POV: Colleges are allowed to run nonprofit at the operating level. \n\nAnd they're *also* allowed to invest their endowments, invest them on a nonprofit basis. \n\nSo don't pay taxes on operating income or investment income.\n\nHarvard endowment $40b. Tax sheltered hedge fund The system is running as designed! \n\nThis is what happens when gov't restricts supply: price escalates. Quality remains stagnant.\n\nNot only that. Gov't also subsidizes demand w/ taxpayer funding, causing price to rise even higher.\n\nWe see the same thing in housing and healthcare. Re: housing. Cities are local monopolies over their own geography.\n\nThe housing policy in many big cities is \"don't build housing\"\n\nOnly 6000 new housing units a year. \n\nWhich leads housing costs to rise significantly.  Which leads gov't to subsidize demand (which caused 2008) What's the difference in a country like the US btw being middle class &amp; lower class?\n\nMiddle class can own a house, send kids to good schools, and get good health insurance.\n\nThose are 3 indicators of quality of life, and gov't has decided to take over and raise prices extremely. What are big questions right now?\n\n- will removing the SAT &amp; GRE dilute the signal?\n- how will colleges financially survive (bailout?)\n- will remote degrees matter as much as a credential?\n- will international students pay?\n- what alternatives will emerge? University format was standardized before the printing press.\n\nIf we built a new system today it'd look totally different. \n\nCOVID presents that option for reset: \"there are decades in which nothing happens. And then there are weeks within which decades happened\" The Credential? Show your work.\n\nIn some fields you can (coding, design), in some you can't (heart surgery). \n\nIf you can show your work, make a profile of all your best work.\n\npeople are building real track records on conscientiousness (if you've done X for years, that counts).

Lending businesses need to have meaningful advantage in either underwriting or distribution:\n\nDistribution: Square capital lends to its own merchant base, which makes acquiring a customer significantly cheaper &amp; easier.

Is it winner take all? \n\nThe holy grail is when there are structural reasons why it's better for consumers and service providers in this industry to be on one common platform?\n\nhttps://t.co/QeTQTxFMAb How concentrated is this market?\n\nPeople will say search advertising is a gigantic market but what makes it hard to compete isn't the fact that it's big as much as it's concentrated.\n\nHard to compete w/ high share incumbents in their home markets. How fragmented is the market?\n\nSometimes, these fragmented markets are less individual markets &amp; more markets of markets. And your ability to go from one market to the next is limited. \n\nHard to build horizontal solutions, but there are opps to build vertical ones (e.g. Veeva) Competing with incumbents: \n\nNeed to compete with them on terms that they won't compete with you\n\nE.g. If you're competing with Facebook you need to compete with them on an axis where they can't (e.g. Something that doesn't fit their biz model, or doesn't fit their privacy model) Economics of the market:\n\nSay you're creating infrastructure for the long-tail in an industry, but it's a hits-driven business where a small fraction brings in 90% of the profits.\n\nUnless you're going to significantly grow the long-tail, it's not a good business Great businesses often shrink markets by passing value to the consumer, but this only works in enormous markets that can still be big after being reduced by an order of magnitude.\n\nSometimes the reason that TAM is high is because the existing solution is needlessly more expensive Inflections that explain the \"why now\" for market growth:\n\n- Technology (new platforms)\n- Adoption (e.g. COVID)\n- Regulatory (e.g. Telemedecine)\n- Belief inflections (e.g. Remote work, Homeschool, College alternatives)\n\n@m2jr has the best stuff on this:\n\nhttps://t.co/sMi0pBeYHz Bottoms up:\n\nTell a story about a specific customer who would buy your product for a specific set of circumstances, and why what they're doing today doesn't work.\n\nShare how the market is underserving a certain set of customers and how you'll expand the market by serving them. Margins: \n\nIf the margins of your business are insanely high, you should expect competitors, and price-based competition.\n\nIf your margins are too low, you'll need to prove you can get a lot of customers and a lot of usage. Ideal to see a connection btw GTM strategy and product.\n\nLooking to see a product, that by being built for an audience in this way, unlocks something that'd be difficult for others to compete with.\n\nhttps://t.co/3WwdcaqTns ",

  "text": "Favorite takeaways &amp; quotes from \"The Courage to Be Disliked\", a book that dives into Adlerian school of psychology, contrasted w/ Freudian.\n\nhttps://t.co/5EqAPjvLlz \"It\u2019s as if you see the world through dark glasses, so  everything is dark\n\nBut if that's the case, instead of lamenting about the darkness, you could remove the glasses\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll want them back on, but can you even take em off in the first place?\n\nDo you have the courage?\" Freudian -- etiology (the study of causation)\n\nAdler -- teleology (the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause)\n\n\"We humans are not so fragile as to be at the mercy of etiological (cause-and-effect) traumas. Adler says choose our lives &amp; our lifestyles\" Freud\u2019s idea is that a person\u2019s psychic wounds (traumas) cause their present unhappiness. \n\nWhen you treat a person\u2019s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality &amp; sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive. But Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: \u201cNo matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.\u201d That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.\" He isn't saying that the experience of a calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong.\n\nBut he's saying we can determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences \"If I stay in my room all the time, without ever going out, I can get all of my parents\u2019 special attention focused on me. \n\nOn the other hand, if I take even one step out of the house, I\u2019ll just become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. No longer special.\" To quote Adler: \u201cThe important thing is not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.\u201d \n\nYou want to be Y or someone else because you are utterly focused on what you were born with. \n\nInstead, you\u2019ve got to focus on what you can make of your equipment. A person wants to be a novelist, but never seems to complete his work. \n\nHe wants to leave the possibility of \u201cI can do it if I try\u201d open, by not committing to anything. \n\nIf he tried and failed, he'd shut the door to that. Many things are like this: invented stories to never try All problems stem from interpersonal relationships; (all joys stem from interpersonal relationship.)\n\nIf you can just be by yourself, you\u2019ll even have a justification ready whenever other people snub you.\n\nThat if you didn't have your shortcomings, you too could be loved. Anger is a form of communication, and communication is possible without using anger. \n\nWe can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for anger. \n\nIf you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all on its own. Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. \n\nIt leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise me, I won\u2019t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I\u2019ll engage in inappropriate actions, too. \u201cFreedom is being disliked by other people.\u201d \n\nThe courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. \n\n(Don't be a jerk but:) \u201cYou have enemies? Good. It means you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d - Churchill \"My father was a moody person. But to blame him for why our relationship went bad is Freudian etiology.\n\nThe Adlerian teleology reverses the cause-and-effect interpretation.\n\ne.g. I brought out the memory of his badness b/c I don\u2019t want my relationship w/ my father to get better\" \"That\u2019s right. For me, it was more convenient to not repair my relationship with my father. I could use having a father like that as an excuse for why my own life wasn\u2019t going well. That for me was a virtue. And there was also the aspect of taking revenge on a feudal father.\" Should strive for, in order:\n\n1. self acceptance\n\n2. confidence in others\n\n3. contribution to others\n\n\u201cPeople are my comrades, the world is a beautiful place.\u201d Out of ten people, two will love you, one will dislike you, and seven won't pay attention to you. \n\nFocus on the two that love you, not the ones that dislike you or the seven who don't care. When one adopts the POV of Freud, one sees life as a great big story based on cause and effect. \n\nSo it's all about where and when I was born, what my childhood was like, the school I attended and the company where I got a job. \n\nThat decides who I am now and who I will become. For Adler, You're not bound by the past. Life isn't a linear narrative. \n\nLife isn't like climbing a mountain. You are not \"en route\". \n\nIt's more like a series of dots/moments. \"Here and now\"\n\nLive like you're dancing: you're enjoying the moment but also going somewhere. As long as you don\u2019t lose sight of guiding star of \u2018I contribute to others\u2019 you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like.\n\nWhether you\u2019re disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free, but don\u2019t care what people say about you \"The greatest life lie is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past and future, cast a dim light on one's entire life, and believe that one has been able to see something.\"\n\n**\n\nWould love to hear any well-reasoned critiques ",

  "text": "Rob Henderson's theory of \"Luxury Beliefs\".\n\nPeople buy luxury goods in order to showcase how rich they are.\n\nIt's precisely b/c they're useless that it brings high status, b/c only wealthy can afford them.\n\nThe message is: \"I'm so rich I can afford to waste money on this.\" But today, luxury goods are more affordable than before.\n\nAnd in a remote world, they're harder to show off. \n\nThus, they're less reliable as indicators of social status.\n\nAmplified by social media, status has shifted to the beliefs we express.\n\nHence, Luxury beliefs. It's not new:\n\n\"Jared Diamond has\u00a0suggested\u00a0that one reason ppl engage in displays such as drinking, smoking, drug use, &amp; other costly behaviors is b/c they serve as fitness indicators.\n\nThe message is:'I\u2019m so healthy that I can afford to poison my body and continue to function\". Luxury beliefs are ideas and opinions that confer status on the rich at very little cost, while taking a toll on the lower class\n\nThey're the ideological equivalent of a luxury good: They signal how well-off people are that they can afford to have beliefs that make them worse off The tragedy w/ luxury beliefs is that, since they're free, &amp; since the non-elites aspire to eliteness, the beliefs themselves trickle down to the masses.\n\nBut since being high status means avoiding what the masses are doing, as soon as the masses adopt them, the elites drop them. The tragedy is that these luxury beliefs are originated by the elites, who get the benefits of short-term high status, but the long-term costs are ultimately borne by the masses.\n\nIt'd be as if the masses bought a ton of expensive shit they didn't need &amp; became saddled w/ debt. Polyamory is an example, popularized by the affluent who often end up in monogamous relationships after flirting w/ polyamory.\n\nThe elites are in a better position to experiment since they can afford protection (&amp; abortion if needed) &amp; can recover thx to financial/social capital. Cycle: An elite flaunts their belief, the masses copy it, so the elite discards it. \n\nThen a new luxury belief emerges, while the old one  causes chaos for the masses\n\nGoods could only cause limited damage b/c they were expensive.

No price transparency. Principal agent problems abound. Why is healthcare so hard?\n\nSo many middle men.\n\nEnterprise = b2b\nConsumer = b2c\nHealthcare = b2b2R2Pc2P2c\n\nBiopharma (Development) \u2014&gt; Regulator (FDA) \u2014&gt; Payer (insurance, employers, gov\u2019t ) \u2014&gt; Channel (pharmacy) -&gt; Provider (physicians, hospitals) \u2014&gt; customer (patient)\n\nh/t a16z Why is healthcare so hard?\n\nIt's like any startup, except everything is 10x harder:\n\nRegulation is tighter, incumbents are more protected, customers move slower, and behaviors are harder to change. \n\nAnd barely any early adopters to sell to! \n\nWhich is why many go full-stack. Malay Gandhi wrote a fantastic piece about why there haven't been enough unicorns--they've played too close to existing system. \n\nhttps://t.co/W2wzhzPIL1\n\nCompanies need to own outcomes. See attached. https://t.co/pas7jrdogv Life science industry is the exception to the rule: you can build a huge business working w/ existing industry.\n\nopportunities in every part of the value chain from drug discovery, clinical trials, commercialization, production, fulfillment, drug pricing, etc. Initially, companies set out to triage things out of existing healthcare ecosystem and build a layer around them.\n\nNext wave focusing on reimagining care from within or from inside out.\n\nStill, more than 30% of costs flow through hospitals. Can unbundle. Unbundling hospitals:\n\n- Most expensive part of healthcare is labor.\n\n- Find ways for physicians to get out of hospitals and closer to patients (e.g. handle back-office, create lower-cost models of running an office) Future of providers involves bifurcation:\n\nEither doctors will go sell to major hospital systems.\n\nOr they'll go w/ insurance companies &amp; cut value based deals.\n\nBig opportunity to help doctors do the latter.\n\nAlso: Virtual clinics (virtual fertility, mental health, pain) Payers:\n\n- 10% of patients account for &gt;50% of costs\n\n- Don't have updated provider networks\n\n- Tough time managing fraud\n\n- Don't have advanced way to do risk segmentation\n\nAre notoriously tough customers so have to make sure can integrate easily w/ existing way of doing things. Consumer: \n\nWhen are we going to see something that  combines telemedicine, wearables, and at home diagnostics so you can properly triage patients and then escalate them properly to the right domain of care for that level of severity?\n\nWhen are we gonna get indexed health data? Consumer:\n\nWhen are we going to see a d2c company that genetically tests you when you\u2019re born and then focuses on optimizing your well-being, mental cognition, and physical abilities for the rest of your life?\n\nhttps://t.co/saQa0UWWIO Consumer:\n\nImagine taking genomic data &amp; lab data and combining it with information from your Apple Watch or another wearable and some app telling you that your blood sugar is low or that you're dehydrated or that you haven't slept enough or that you need to eat X. Our view of healthcare is so narrow.\n\nIt's optimized for acute care (when you're sick, or something's broken), not preventive care.\n\nIn theory, apps like Foursquare (food), Strava (exercise) &amp; Tinder (relationships) should be tied to our health profiles. Build inside or outside the system?\n\nYou either have to be:\n\n1) full stack (take on the entire vertical of pharmacy, clinical trials, insurance, etc.) \n\nor 2) barely touching the existing healthcare system\n\nFramework h/t @nikillinit: \"If you want to simplify the pharmacy, then you have to be a delivery system, distributor, &amp; PBM all in one.\n\nif you want to do insurance, you have to get into care itself.\n\nif you want to be in the clinical trial space, you have to be someone that runs the clinical trial itself\" \"OR, you operate tangentially next to healthcare space\n\neither in primary care (one medical, nurx etc.) which doesn't have to touch the existing system unless it absolutely needs to, which means it can build its own systems in house\" Another framework:\n\nEither you commit to going through heavy amounts of proof building (clinical trials, pilots, publishing in peer reviewed journals) OR you go direct to consumer and gather millions of users like any other consumer app. Both brutally hard. One Medical for X:\n\n- One Medical worked b/c it was a great perk for employers to offer their employees.\n\n- Consumers won't pay for any commodity specialist. It has to be something where there's high variance in quality (e.g diabetes, musculoskeletal, mental health, dental) Nurx for X:\n\nTraditional mail order pharmacy brands haven't innovated on distribution. They don't have direct relationship w/ consumers.\n\nNew brands are segmenting against category as a result (Hims &amp; ED, Brightside &amp; mental health, Nurx &amp; women's health) EMR:\n\nEpic will continue to dominate for a long time b/c hard to rip out (exception here is primary care)\n\nStandard value of Epic is not to make a doctor's life easier. It's to do revenue cycle management properly. Opportunity: Legitimize &amp; Curate alternative-eastern medicine.\n\nBig demand from consumers, a lot of it is snake oil.\n\nA company can solve for access, quality, and guidance. Distribution:\n\nSo many great products fail in healthcare b/c no one cares.\n\nIt must fit within an existing budget item or reimbursement code that they provide to the market around the service.\n\nSelf-insured employer channel is crowded Many companies struggle going d2c, then try to go b2b, but typically fail b/c they just haven't solved a strong enough pain point for the consumer. That's why d2c didn't work. Paraphrasing Cunningham's law, which explains why I post some of these: \"The best way to get the right answer on the internet isn't to ask general questions. It's to post simplistic explanations and have people correct you &amp; expound upon them.\" ",

  "text": "A summary of Stephen Hicks' book \"Explaining Post-modernism\" \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://t.co/0fjWx2LJxo Postmodernism often bills itself as anti-philosophical, by which it means that it rejects many traditional philosophical alternatives. \n\nBut despite its official distaste for some versions of the the universal...postmodernism offers a consistent framework of premises. Postmodernism is anti-realist, holding that it is impossible to speak meaningfully about an independently existing reality. \n\nHaving done this, postmodernism denies that reason or any other method is means of acquiring objective knowledge of that reality. Postmodern accounts of human nature are collectivist, holding that individuals\u2019 identities are constructed largely by the social-linguistic groups that they are a part of.\n\nThese groups are consistently in conflict, and those conflicts are resolved by force (masked or naked) Post modern cultural debates:\n\n- Columbus modern hero or imperialist?\n- is USA &amp; the west broadly progressive on liberalism or an oppressor?\n- Is technology net positive?\n- is liberalism universal? \n- Should people be treated as individuals or as groups? \n\nhttps://t.co/FAPDQxmBu1 What makes these conflicts post-modern? That the terms have shifted.\n\n\u201cTruth\u201d is a myth. \u201cReason\u201d is a white male Eurocentric construct. \u201cEquality\u201d is a mask for oppressions. \u201cPeace\u201d and \u201cProgress\u201d are met w/ reminders of power.\n\nFar left &amp; far right are converging.\n\nSmithsonian: https://t.co/kiZ8SMujCl How did post-modernism come about? Hicks traces the history by starting w/ Kant.\n\nKant asserted that people couldn't perceive reality outside of the mind. It was all subjective.\n\nTo speak of truth as an external relationship between mind and reality is nonsense, Kant claimed Of the five major features of Enlightenment reason\u2014objectivity, competence, autonomy, universality, and being an individual faculty\u2014Kant rejects objectivity. \n\nOnce reason is so severed from reality, the rest is\ndetails\u2014details that are worked out over the next two centuries. After Kant it was Hegel.\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s focused on epistemology, Hegel\u2019s focused on  metaphysics. \n\n- Reality is subjective and has contradictions\n- Since reality evolves contradictorily, truth is relative to time &amp; place\n- The collective, not the individual, is the operative unit The postmodernists abandoned Hegel's metaphysics * put Nietzschean power struggles at the core of our being. \n\nAnd especially in the cases of Foucault &amp; Derrida, most postmodernists abandoned Nietzsche \u2019s sense of the exalted potential of man &amp; embraced Heidegger\u2019s anti-humanism. Note this was a 180 for the far left:\n\nSocialism accepted evidence, reason, logic, tolerance, and civility. \n\nIt was only when socialism performed so badly that those tools became enemies, because they were no longer useful to furthering socialism. Socialists argued that capitalism was driven by a logic of competitive exploitation that would cause its eventual collapse and that socialism\u2019s communal form of production, by contrast, would prove to be economically superior.\n\nThey hoped for an eventual class war that never came Morally, capitalism was evil both because of the self-interested motives of those engaged in competition and b/c  of the exploitation and alienation that competition caused.\n\nSocialism, by contrast, would be based on selfless sacrifice and communal sharing.\n\n...This didn't happen So reason had nothing to offer the far-left.\n\nWhat mattered now was will, authentic, and non-rational commitment.\n\nMarxism failed. Class was not strong enough binder to foment a revolution. So the left rebranded to focusing on identity groups, which were more binding &amp; permanent https://t.co/oQ7sP5jkyy If one is interested in truth , then one\u2019s rational response to a failing theory is as follows:\n\n- Break down theory into its premises, question them vigorously and check the logic that integrates them.\n- Seek out alternatives\n- Accept moral responsibility for consequences. But they'd rather throw out truth altogether.\n\nEchoing Dostoyevski, \"If the truth was outside of Christ,\nI would rather remain with Christ than with the truth.\u201d\n\nBoth religion and socialism started with a comprehensive\nvision that they believed to be true but not based on reason Post-modernists are the new sophists.\n\nThe Sophists taught rhetoric not as a means of advancing truth and knowledge but as a means of winning\ndebates in the rough-and-tumble world of day-to-day politics. Coming after two millennia of Christianity and two centuries of socialist theory\u2014post modernists believe that  Subjectivism and relativism are true, except\nthat the postmodernists are on the side of the weaker and\nhistorically-oppressed groups. Consider the following claims. \n\nOn the one hand, all truth is relative; on the other hand, postmodernism tells it like it really is. \n\nOn the one hand, all cultures are equally deserving of respect; on the other, Western culture is uniquely destructive and bad. (Cont):\n\nTechnology is bad and destructive\u2014and it is unfair that some people have more than others. \n\nTolerance is good and dominance is bad\u2014but when postmodernists come to power, thought police follows.\n\nSubjectivism and relativism in one breath, dogmatic absolutism in the next.

  "text": "Aggregated my thoughts on VC in one place:\n\n- Structural advantages in VC\n- Why we need *more* founders &amp; *more* VCs\n- The case for diversified portfolios &amp; no pro-rata\n- Venture socialism\n- How to break into VC\n- How VC evolved\n- The future of VC\n- The role of pre-seed\n\nThread\ud83d\udc47 People think there is too much capital: Too many founders, too many VCs\n\nIMO, we need more founders &amp; VCs\n\nWhy? Schramm's law: \"The single most important contributor to a nation\u2019s economic growth is the number of start-ups that grow to a billion dollars in revenue within 20 yrs.\u201d We produce ~33 unicorns a yr. \n\nWe need ~100 unicorns a year to maintain post WWII growth rates.\n\nHow can we get more founders? De-risk it.\n\nMake median founder outcome closer to avg &amp; by removing economic friction. Remove other bottlenecks (thread)\n\nhttps://t.co/K9naMtc8QW Indeed: There are lots of VCs who could make great founders, who would actually prefer to build a business than do a financial services job, but they just prefer the economic calculus of venture capital. \n\nOthers, to be sure, are unwilling or incapable.\n\nhttps://t.co/KJXWgohcaA We also should decrease cultural friction to starting companies:\n\n- celebrate starting cos as a thing for ambitious ppl to do globally\n\n- see startup failures on resumes as badges of honor instead of blemishes\n\n- create communities to find co-founders &amp; founder support(@beondeck) Other things holding founders back.\n\nStartup formation tropes are too romantic. e.g:\n\n- had an idea they were passionate about or were perfect customer for\n- knew co-founder since college\n- wanted to be founder, didn't \"stumble\"\n- founder was all-in.\n\nhttps://t.co/rurn6eT13i But the real reason not to listen to VC advice b/c VCs don\u2019t listen to their own advice\n\nhttps://t.co/gqP55x8LzK Irony: Although VCs believe in markets, in some ways VCs are Central Planners\u2014a few partners deciding all investments (&amp; prices), across all sectors, geographies, &amp; people\u2014even tho they can't have perfect information on all.\n\nVenture Capital? More like Venture Soviet Russia. ;) Just as one person could have understood all of physics at one point, it was possible for one person to specialize at \u201cinternet investing\u201d and be an expert at all. \n\nThis is why we at @villageglobal (&amp; others) are trying to decentralize venture:\n\nhttps://t.co/E3ZOiUA7mf Startup investing\u2019s weird bc it takes 10+ yrs to be great\u2014not bc of skills gained but bc of feedback loops\n\nYou could invest for 3 yrs, be a beginner, go in a coma for 7 yrs, come back &amp; be known as an \"expert\", despite same level of skill\n\nIn which other field could this happen? Another VC/bball analogy:\n\nIn bball you can discover Giannis when he\u2019s 15 &amp; he can dominate day 1\n\nThe VC Giannis has to wait yrs for their dominance to be recognized\n\nThis suggests there\u2019s extra arbitrage in finding the VC Giannis\u2014the ppl who are already great but not legibly so Poker is a misleading analogy for VC, b/c it implies an equally distributed deck.\n\nA great firm gets pocket aces every time, a bad firm never sees an ace.\n\nWhat's hard isn't knowing how to play pocket aces, it\u2019s building the machine that repeatably gets pocket aces to begin with. In other words, ppl think VC is about sourcing, picking, &amp; supporting cos.\n\nInvesting isn\u2019t totally a craft (bc of long feedback loops), but it also isn\u2019t (all) abt luck, either. \n\nIMO it's about having a structural advantage:\n\nhttps://t.co/zgAy11P6lI VC is neither chess nor poker. It's more like war.\n\nIt\u2019s basically your ability to rig the game\u2014to build a machine that enables you to see &amp; get into the best deals.\n\nThat machine could be a reputation, a network, a platform \u2014but it has to be differentiated from other machines. More and more of seed investing is adding so much value to founders *before* they raise so that when they do, they feel compelled to make room for you.\n\nhttps://t.co/afJXAiJ3BL VC firms don't have many proprietary assets\n\nYou could steal Benchmark's playbook + it wouldn't change much, similar to how copying Lebron's regimen wouldn't let you compete\n\nPartially bc \ud83d\udc47, + also long feedback loops means VC brands are self-reinforcing\n\nhttps://t.co/utGJwQ5asm Exception: YC. \n\nThey changed the game by showing that VC could:\n\n- Scale founder support through...other founders (network effects)\n- Have portfolio diversity &amp; ownership &amp; keep quality high, debunked \u201cspray and pray\u201d\n- Be a franchise in Warren Buffet sense\n- Pricing power Debunked following absolutisms:\n\n- VC has anti-network effects\n- Wide portfolios compromise quality &amp; support\n- VC is not a startup, product, or platform\n- There are no moats besides brand\n- VC has to be an artisan craft\n\nOf course, these are often true, but not always VC narratives:\n\nVCs have magic so they can pick winners. \n\n*\"The Midas List\"*\n\nThey also have this magic where they can \u201cmake\u201d winners with their help and advice.  \n\nOnly they have the magic so they can only make a few investments so there\u2019s enough of the magic to go around If as a VC you wanted to sound the most indispensable:\n\n- Startups are really hard to pick\n- VCs can uniquely help make companies great\n- Only ppl w/ VC experience can be good VCs\n\nYou\u2019d pick a GP-centric concentrated strategy!\n\nWider portfolio implies picking &amp; helping humility. In reality, diversified portfolios can make sense too.\n\nWhy? VC is a hits-driven business. The top 2.5% of vc-backed companies\u2014100/4,000\u2014make up all the returns.\n\nGetting into one of those w/ meaningful ownership is everything.\n\nAvg unicorn rate is 2.5%.\n\nhttps://t.co/yWJIONIJn3 Your fund size is your strategy. \n\nYour best co will return 1/2 of all profit. And then the 2nd best might return a 1/4 &amp; the next best might return an 1/8 &amp; so on\n\nFor $100m fund, you need 1 co to return $150M, so that's 10% at 1.5B or 1% at 15B.\n\nNeed (meaningful) shots on goal If you consider founders more helpful than investors, and investors not that a helpful, then what\u2019s actually most founder friendly is having a big portfolio\n\nWhich is why founders love YC\n\nAfter one institutional VC, there\u2019s serious diminishing returns. Follow-ons make sense most when they are doubling down or not at all.\n\nWhy? They are competing with every other opportunity out there, and artificially limiting to your own pool makes most sense when you have conviction.\n\nhttps://t.co/QZ33X4j00o Founders don't want to raise money from institutions as much anymore. \n\nThey want to raise money from individuals.\n\nHow VC got unbundled: https://t.co/716W2MjBYI VCs have to signal that\n\n- they have conviction in individual cos, but their incentive is to run a portfolio &amp; hedge their bets \n\n- they can uniquely help founders, but their incentive is to spend time finding new cos\n\n- they are builders too, but they're financiers 1st One bearish take on VC value add is that, because capital is such a commodity, what's surprisingly helpful to founders &amp; angels when looking to fill out rounds is VC firms that decide quickly &amp; transparently. To be sure, VCs used to be able to add a lot of value. \n\n15 years ago, the VC who sat on 10 boards had genuinely novel info to share with a founder \n\nE.g. PM-fit, hiring, sales, fund-raising...\n\nNow 99% of startup questions are available via blogs &amp; online content. Getting a job in venture capital is partly less about \u201cwho you know\u201d and more about \u201cwho you\u2019ve helped.\u201d \n\nStart creating a personal portfolio of projects that allow you to help others, especially around getting into deals, and you may break into VC\n\nAlso: https://t.co/ncANag5MB1 If you are looking to join a VC firm, the question the firm needs to be able to answer is:\n\n\u201cIs this person going to help me to invest in companies that I otherwise would not have invested in without him/her?\u201d\n\nHow do you do this?\n\nhttps://t.co/iLr4RPOtPw If you\u2019re a up-and-coming VC trying to build a name for yourself I think there\u2019s a big opportunity in niche podcasting.\n\nMake the go-to-podcast for healthcare, VR, DTC\u2014pick any topic.\n\nIt\u2019ll build your network in that space &amp; you\u2019ll be the first person people think of for deals. Some smart person looking to break into venture should create a Stratechery for early stage VC.\n\nTake the fundraising announcements and explain &amp; analyze the broader trends behind them.\n\nOther ideas on breaking into VC: https://t.co/iLr4RPOtPw Airbnb Dropbox Coinbase etc\n \nIn ~every YC co, other VCs put in over 10x more $ +time.\n \nAnd yet, in founder interviews, YC gets comparable love.\n \nThat's the power of putting people in business, &amp; believing in people when others don't.\n\nBe first check in! VC is very reflexive: Perception becomes reality because of long feedback loops. Get #s on the board early then if you know you want to do it long-term.\n\nhttps://t.co/QYpGXYIHyC LPs don't want VCs to have big diversified portfolios b/c LPs  are already sufficiently diversified\n\nVCs don't want founders to diversify b/c VCs are already sufficiently diversified\n\nIt's Go All In or Go Home all the way down\n\nhttps://t.co/LWVlWakiFp How does COVID-19 affect LP/VC market for new funds?\n\nSome thoughts paraphrased from a conversation with an older VC who's been through a couple cycles. Down pointing backhand index\n\n(Curious for alternative perspectives.)\n\nhttps://t.co/LrDwC2Ko9V How do we fund science and longer-term projects?\n\nhttps://t.co/NHVOgDIWSU Pre-seed is about proving customer value, not revenue.\n\nConsider a restaurant: The KPI to track is not whether customers ate &amp; paid, it\u2019s whether they finished their plates, took some food home, and came back again.\n\n(more wisdom from @AliBHamed) Series A is b2b, Seed is b2c.\n\nAt Series A, your customers are the founder + other seed firms\n\nAt Seed, your customer is the founder. You need to be top of mind b4 they start co. Wide net\n\nExplains why seed firms spend more time on Twitter &amp; later stage spend more time networking On VC/founder relationship being a marriage:\n\nMaybe a more precise analogy is a divorced couple w/ a kid. \n\nThere\u2019s some alignment, some misalignment\u2014sometimes they want you there, sometimes they don\u2019t\u2014\n\nSometimes you flourish as co-parents, sometimes they kick you out &amp; sue you. Future of VC:\n\nVC funds technical risk. \n\nInstead of MBAs running spreadsheets trying to figure out CAC to LTV, they\u2019re funding companies that are trying to cure cancer, develop flying cars, extend life, get us to the moon\u2026 \"I would hope that people go back and look at 2018 and 2019 and say I can\u2019t believe that founders sold 50-80% of their companies before IPOs to pay for Facebook and Google ads. You\u2019re basically selling 50-80% of your company to Facebook and Google.\" - Andrew D'Souza \"VC branded itself well, right? You have these smart people who put together these fancy websites and basically said that if you raise from XYZ firm, you\u2019re going to be successful. But it was this false promise. It\u2019s caused cos to take capital they wouldn't otherwise - Ali Hamed Being a VC used to be about technical risk, then it evolved and became also about market risk. \n\nHow to evaluate markets?\n\nPeter Thiel vs Keith Rabois approach to markets\n\nhttps://t.co/VhERuXhCX1 in 2005, PG discovered an arbitrage opportunity by identifying that young technical founders were being overlooked\n\nin 2019, with the rise of no-code &amp; the intense focus on technical founders, perhaps the pendulum has swung + a new arbitrage opp is biz &amp; product minded founders Domain expertise is more important now\n\nSoftware's eaten low hanging fruit &amp; now going for more\n\nFor areas within logistics, healthcare, finance\u2014expertise &amp; relationships matter\n\nWe used to think only founders can learn domain expertise\n\nBut experts can also learn to be founders Maybe this is why recently it seems VC partners have more leverage over their firms than they did before\n\nIf vesting worked differently, we'd likely see VC look more like NBA free agency--more switching. Maybe that changes overtime.\n\nhttps://t.co/9tL9PAp8Nk The venture firm that most captured where tech startup ethos was going in 2014-2017 was a16z imo.\n\nIn 2020 and beyond, esp if Warren wins, I think that leader may be Founders Fund (w a16z leading here too)\n\nThe difference between peace time and war time ethos In the last decade, angel investing became a status symbol (in contrast to stodgy VC)\n\nIn the next decade, being a talent discoverer&amp;curator will become a status symbol (in contrast to transactional recruiter)\n\nISAs enable this: investments become person specific, not co specific ",

  "text": "Is technological progress causing unemployment?\n\nA summary of this Slate Star Codex post \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/CERd1RFUQR Progress hasn't led to unemployment in the past.\n\nEvery time we get technological progress, either machines augment human workers or they expand industries so that they can employ more workers (e.g. ATMs meant more bank tellers)\n\nAKA lump of labor fallacy: https://t.co/tcUFqOUzjX Argument against: In the long run, perhaps the tech gets so good that instead of augmenting people it will replace them.\n\nHere's that argument and counters to it: https://t.co/rwrS2u17DZ More germane to now, sometimes there is a lag btw the time it takes to automate jobs away and create the ones that replacement, &amp; people suffer in the interim.\n\nAutomation &amp; globalization contribute to short-term unemployment but there's no reason to believe that it is permanent. Well before COVID, unemployment was at historic lows.\n\nThat's partly a measurement issue, as we had more and more people outside of the workforce altogether, for a whole host of reasons (e.g. baby boomers retiring, more disabled people) https://t.co/1nKFvITmcQ \"In the 1950s, ~97% (!) of prime-age men had a job. Today that number is more like 88%. This is the decline people are worrying about when they talk about technological unemployment or any other threat to work, and it seems to be happening across the Western world\" https://t.co/zU0tA1caFa What happened to the million working-age men who are not in the workforce? Lots of unsatisfactory explanations.\n\nMaybe it's the more miserable your work is, and the more decent options you have available to you (in terms of gov't support), the more likely you are to leave work.

  "text": "High-level thoughts on remote work:\n\n- Advantages\n- Frameworks for thinking about it\n- Hiring\n- Compensation\n- 2nd order effects\n- Remote as an investible category\n\nMuch of this inspired by conversations w/ @andreasklinger &amp; @photomatt &amp; others. How did remote work go mainstream?\n\n- Cost of housing &amp; employment soared (particularly in SF)\n\n- Better tech (Zoom &amp; Slack)\n\n- Successful distributed companies emerged (e.g Automatic, Gitlab, InVision)\n\n\"Soon SF will be only for founders &amp; bankers, &amp; everyone else distributed\" What are the advantages to remote work?\n\n- Happier employees\n- Same quality labor for lower cost\n- Higher quality of life\n- Broader talent pool\n- Longer retention (avg retention in SF is 16 months) Remote doesn't mean outsourcing or freelancing or digital nomad-ing or working from home.\n\nMost remote workers are working in a highly professional setup at a dedicated office and work at hours that are optimized for their productivity Innovation often easier in person.\n\nIf you need to do like a major pivot, it's easier if you get like product people together in front of a whiteboard and just discuss it.\n\nConflict management certainly easier in person.\n\nIteration is easier remote. InVision Model is to keep everyone on the same time zone.\n\nThey say you can work anywhere, but you have to work on east coast hours.\n\nGitlab has an emphasis on asynchronous communication. If you have 3 hrs of overlap, schedule meetings then.\n\nThere's no single right model. Hiring remotely:\n\nChallenge is it's hard to evaluate international CVs\u2014you don't know the university or company brands, &amp; there are also cultural differences that make evaluating talent hard\n\nThe solution is to focus on real work\n\nPick a challenge you understand &amp; have them do it Compensation:\n\nSome people think should pay equally everywhere. Others think you should pro-rate to cost-of-living. No silver bullet.\n\nProbably makes sense to keep equal equity regardless.\n\nDon't overpay them in contract such that they don't want to join!\n\nAny thoughts here? Remote isn't a binary decision. It's a spectrum.\n\nEverybody's already working remote. The Q now is like, How much?\n\nFully distributed? or HQ but remote-first? Same or different time zones? Managing remote:\n\nOptimize for single player mode:\n\nMeaning, empower people to make decisions without having layers of bureaucracy. \n\nMicro-managing remote doesn't work well. Some people make all remote work, some make all co-located work, and some make hybrid work.\n\nIt's an art to thread the needle between doing working asynchronously in documents vs meeting synchronously to discuss pivots &amp; key product decisions. Remote as a category:\n\nOne way to think about it is communication tools, payroll, benefits, healthcare, etc.\n\nA broader way of thinking about it is that remote companies are perfect early customers: since they have higher complexity, they're more willing to try stuff early. Future of Private Equity is remote work.\n\nTalent arbitrage is one obvious reason: \n\nBuy companies. Fire expensive people &amp; replace them with people globally who are just as good or better *and* cheaper. 2nd order effects: Boon for rural areas. You don't need to move to a city to work at a tech company anymore. You don't need to move to the U.S.\n\nhttps://t.co/3Cwlwn6gdB \"Saying I'm an expert for remote work is like saying I'm an expert at standing desks\n\nThis button goes up, this button goes down\n\nYes, it has advantages &amp; disadvantages\n\nBut ultimately, your success isn't determined by whether you have a standing desk, you know?\"-@andreasklinger To go deeper:\n\nfollow @andreasklinger. \n\nListen: \n\nhttps://t.co/EzyuoXjbEI\n\nhttps://t.co/udXCnzxlgF ",

The \"connected\" comes from the utility YC provides The filter is acceptance rate.\n\n1% means much more than 5% in terms of valuing YC's talent rating.\n\nUtility is how much more valuable the startup is bc of the program. e.g Bigger network = bigger chance of success\n\nFilter is pre-program. Utility is post\n\nSignal = Filter + Utility There's more to signal than filter\n\nThiel Fellowship (TF) has higher filter than YC\n\nBut many would choose YC b/c it has higher utility\n\n- more legible to investors, hires, &amp; your parents\n- more alumni you can sell to or raise from\n\nFor utility, quantity has a quality all its own Curation businesses need to align filter w/ utility\n\nUtility pulls you in the direction of expanding size. The more ppl there are, the more total opportunity there can be\n\nFilter pulls you in the direction of less. The more ppl there are, the less likely the quality of avg person Focus too much on utility (get too big), and you kill the signal.\n\nFocus too much on signal itself without bolting on utility, then it becomes like Harvard \u2014 people know it has no purpose other than the signal and that itself weakens the signal.\n\nIt becomes a bubble. \n\nExamples: TF has stronger signal than YC but not as much utility\n\nYC has weaker signal than TF but more utility\n\nHarvard is stuck in a bit of a hopeless middle: it\u2019s neither so big that there's a ton of utility nor so small that it\u2019s super curated. (It wins b/c it\u2019s a monopoly.) If you\u2019re building a curation business, your goal should be to start with meaningful signal and then optimize for utility as soon as possible, without compromising signal.\n\nWhich is why YC scaled to 200+ companies &amp; didn't miss a beat, &amp; why Harvard can scale too (to some point) ",

But the lowest-paid workers don't have health insurance. And even for the ones who do, it doesn't explain the wage gap https://t.co/IMZDSICDxe Maybe it's changing demographics?\n\nThe workforce has changed a lot since 1973. Many women entered the workforce for the first time, and if they got paid less maybe that'd lower the avg wage.\n\nBut women's income is actually rising as fast as productivity, so that's likely not it. https://t.co/pKGAyNWWwK Maybe it's some esoteric mismeasurement problem that either explains most of it or all of it away: https://t.co/WxsZweycfv\n\n\"Depending on how you prefer to think about inflation, median wages have probably risen about 40% \u2013 50% since 1973, about half as much as productivity.\" Maybe it's just increasing Labor-Vs-Capital inequality?\n\nLabor-vs-capital inequality is about how much wage earners earn vs. how much capitalists get in profits.\n\nBut that inequality started decreasing in 2000s, when wages and productivity really decoupled, so that's not it. Maybe just old-fashioned wage inequality?\n\nWell, if you add in total compensation, the avg worker is doing almost as well as they did in 1973\n\nA few high-earners are taking a lot of the pie, keeping the mean constant but lowering the median. This is probably the biggest factor. https://t.co/AjOZ32rKLK \"Remember, productivity has grown by 70-100% through this period. So even though the top 5% have seen their incomes grow by 69%, they\u2019re still not growing as fast as productivity. The top 1% have grown slightly faster than productivity, but the top 0.1% are doing the best.\" Or is wage inequality increasing b/c technology is automating middle-class jobs and pushing them to lower-class jobs?\n\nMaybe somewhat. It explains some top-10% people doing  better, but it doesn't explain the top-1% performance. Maybe policy changes are exacerbating the decoupling?\n\nSome people point to:\n\n- Decline in unions\n- Lack of corporate governance preventing CEO-pay restrictions\n- Tax changes (When there are higher taxes, CEOs negotiate less?) Even taking out mismeasurement, there is still decoupling btw median wages &amp; productivity. \n\nMost important factor is probably wage inequality, followed by other breakdowns.

  "text": "Another summary of some of Peter Thiel's thoughts \ud83d\udc47\n\nHere's a summary I did a while ago:\nhttps://t.co/ghXx8nq8Dc Consensus is is that we are doing great and that everything is just moving super fast.\n\nAnd we can debate whether it\u2019s utopian or dystopian, but it's happening.\n\nPeter believes growth has stalled and has for a while. More insight into Peter's thoughts here:https://t.co/SDM2SYVsK8 We're no longer moving faster.\n\nThe acceleration of travel speeds\u2014from faster sailing ships in the 16th through 18th centuries, to the advent of faster railroads in the 19th century, and still-faster cars and airplanes in the 20th century\u2014reversed in 2003 w/ the Concorde failure. The official explanation for the slowdown in travel centers on the high cost of fuel, which points to the much larger failure in energy innovation. \n\nNixon\u2019s 1974 call for full energy independence by 1980 has given way to Obama\u2019s 2011 call for one-third oil independence by 2020. If you think about where oil prices were in 1973 - it was $2 a barrel - in 2012 it was $100 a barrel. \n\nAnd so you\u2019ve had a failure of energy innovation, &amp; it\u2019s basically been offset by computer innovation\u2014That\u2019s a simplified account of what\u2019s happened in the last 40 years. When thinking about stalled growth...\n\nTo a 1st approximation, the progress in computers &amp; failure in energy appear to have roughly canceled each other out\n\nLike Alice in the Red Queen\u2019s race, we (&amp; our computers) have been forced to run faster &amp; faster to stay in the same place Life expectancy isn't rising as fast as it used to.\n\nWe see fewer blockbuster drugs in the pipeline\u2014perhaps because of the intransigence of the FDA, perhaps because of the fecklessness of today\u2019s biological scientists, &amp; perhaps because of all the complexity of human biology. In 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first person on the moon.\n\nWe haven't been back to the moon since 1972 and with the final Shuttle flight in 2011, the US will be without the ability to send an astronaut into orbit for the first time since it began its manned space program. The 1969 version was: we landed on the moon in July of 1969 and Woodstock starts three weeks later. And maybe that's one way you could describe the cultural shift. There is a Marxist theory that the time for Communism would come when interest rates went to zero because the zero percent interest rate was a sign that capitalists no longer had any idea what to do with their money, &amp; thus they should redistribute the capital\n\nWe're out of ideas We live in a world where we've been working on the Star Trek computer in Silicon Valley, but we don't have anything else from Star Trek.\n\nWe don't have the warp drive, we don't have the transporter, we can't re-engineer matter in this cornucopian world where there is no scarcity. In the 50s and 60s, technology meant atoms in addition to bits. \n\nIt meant biotech, medical devices. It meant nuclear power, new forms of energy, underwater cities, the green revolution in agriculture, space travel, supersonic aviation, flying cars, etc. Consider the classic versions of science fiction cities: underwater, cities on the moon, cities on Mars cities in outer space.\n\nRadically different and very definite ideas of the future, that would become self-fulfilling prophecies of one sort or another.\n\nThese views look dated. Name one sci-fi film in the last 25 years in which tech is portrayed in a positive light, in which it\u2019s not dystopian, it doesn\u2019t kill people, it doesn\u2019t destroy the world, etc. \n\nInstead, we have one sort of catastrophic, anti-technological scenario after another The future of the computer in 1969 was centralization, large governments, large companies. \n\nFast-forward to 1999. The future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. Libertarian utopia.\n\nFast-forward to 2019. The status quo has swung back to 1969. The era of globalization improved living standards by making labor and goods cheaper, but also hurt living standards through increased competition for limited resources. Free-trade advocates tend to think that the first effect dominates the second. When you talk about AI as the last computing device where you\u2019re building a mind that can outthink &amp; outwit any human being, you end up with these very scary &amp; political questions: Is it going to be friendly? Is it dangerous? \n\nNot, what is this going to do to unemployment? The Google propaganda is that we have runaway technological progress many people will be left behind, and we need to take care of them. \n\nThis doesn't show up in any of the data. We have 3.5% unemployment and the productivity numbers are still anemic. The data point people always give is self-driving cars. \n\nEven if you got them, it might replace at most 1 percent of the workforce, it might increase productivity by a few percent in the economy. \n\nIf you phased them in over a decade, it would not be that transformative. We've actually had *less* automation. \n\nkindergarten teachers, nurses, yoga instructors, all these sort of nontradeable service sector jobs are fairly immune to automation. If we had this sort of runaway automation, you could get to 3%, 4% GDP growth, and at 3% to 4% GDP growth, we can solve these problems socially.\n\nThen there will be a lot more room for various social programs\n\nIf automation's happening, then we'll see in the productivity numbers And, given sufficient automation, then eventually maybe we need something like UBI. If automation is not happening and you do UBI, then you just blow up the economy. \n\nEven a Marxist thinks you have to first get the capitalists to do things before you can redistribute stuff. We\u2019re not allowed to develop new drugs with the FDA charging $1.3 billion per new drug. \n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to fly supersonic jets because they\u2019re too noisy. \n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to build nuclear power plants.\n\nWe've outlawed the world of atoms, so ppl focus on bits. If you give me a choice of getting rid of the vast bulk of government regulations &amp; keeping the Fed, I\u2019d much rather do that than keeping all the other zoning laws &amp; crazy rules we have and going with PayPal, Bitcoin, gold, any sort of alternate currency one could come up with. Why did brilliant people in the Soviet Union become grandmaster chess players? They weren\u2019t allowed to do anything else.\u2028\n\nSame with why so many brilliant rocket scientists went into wall street, because they couldn't use their skills due to overregulation. It\u2019s hard to remember this, but gov't was once high tech, too: The Apollo program put a man on the moon.  \n\nBut today our government is broken. Our newest fighter jets can\u2019t even fly in the rain.\n\nThat is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan project. Science has gotten dramatically worse, by being a victim of its own success.\n\nWe poured money on it, which politicized the system. But a great scientist is the opposite of a good politician. A scientist is someone who pursues truth. A politician manipulates truth. So we miss out. A lot of innovators discovered things, but weren\u2019t able to get anything. \n\nTesla was out-competed by Edison, even though Edison had an inferior technology. \n\nThe Wright brothers came up with the first airplane, but they didn\u2019t get to be rich.\n\nEinstein discovered relativity--nada When were the last political speeches you can remember where people in very concrete terms portrayed a future that looks very different from the present? \n\nGorbachev: \u201cTear down that wall\"\n\nWe've gotten more vague: \"Hope and Change\"\n\nIt didn't do well. People are scared of change The 1990s narrative was the new economy, and they lied about growth.\n\nAnd then the 2000s narrative was the Great Moderation, and they lied about volatility.\n\nAnd maybe the 2010s one is secular stagnation, where they lie about the real interest rates, b/c the other two don't work. Why the slowdown?\n\nIs it an external reality that\u2019s made it hard or is it something in the culture that\u2019s changed that makes us less ambitious?\n\nCulture. We\u2019re often too biased to go to the natural explanation b/c it\u2019s one that exonerates us from responsibility for the slowdown Extreme optimism &amp; extreme pessimism are both equally wrong. \n\nWe should always come back to the question of individual agency and it's not these large historic forces. \n\nThere's always room for history, for new ideas, and these things are never definitively decided either way. Think a lot harder about the future...try to think concretely what you want to do...there's always a question, where is the frontier, where are some pockets of innovation where you can do some new things and not be in a crazed competition.\n\n3 possible technological frontiers: Cyberspace:  The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. \n\nThe limitation of the Internet is that these new worlds are virtual and that any escape may be more imaginary than real. \n\nStill TBD. Outer space: Because the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics. \n\nBut we are still ways away from being ready for this. Seasteading: Between cyberspace &amp; outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans. \n\nThe tech involved is more tentative than the Internet, but more realistic than space travel. \n\nWe may have reached the stage at which it will soon be economically feasible.

  "text": "I've been interested in the idea of Founder Schools -- institutions that help founders pick startup ideas, find co-founders, &amp; take the leap.\n\nThese have been looked down upon, but IMO that's b/c of their execution, not b/c the concept isn't valuable.\n\nhttps://t.co/kDxdndSVUz Why does the world benefit from Founder Schools?\n\nBecause the world benefits from more founders. \n\nWhy? Aren't there too many founders?\n\nNo IMO. More good founders likely means more overall innovation \n\nhttps://t.co/70EmGXNRIw We need more investors too while we're at it.\n\nWhy? Aren't there too many investors? isn't there too much capital? \n\nNo IMO. Maybe it hurts the average investor, or has some negative side effects, but it also leads to more founders which is net positive: https://t.co/70EmGXNRIw Why would founder schools work when they didn't before?\n\nWell, YC worked. It was a specific type of education for a specific type of founder.\n\nNow that it's easier for non-technical founders to build products, more people can more easily be founders.\n\nhttps://t.co/RlF47Jc5sG Wait: Isn't it a bad idea to match co-founders? Shouldn't they be people they've known since college or worked with before?\n\nThat would be great, but that constrains the pool significantly, and many co-founder teams don't fit that bill.\n\nhttps://t.co/lMrDXc9woQ Wait: Isn't it a bad idea for founders to soberly evaluate startup ideas, as opposed to seized in the middle of the night by a eureka moment?\n\nIt's great when solving their own problem and/or they've been thinking about it for years, but doesn't have to.\n\nhttps://t.co/rurn6eT13i Wait: Isn't it adverse selection for any founder to go through such a program? Aren't the best founders total rebels? Can entrepreneurship even be learned anyway? \n\nThere might be some truth there, but they prove too much in their conclusion.\n\nMore here: https://t.co/yF3NMO2TO4 Wait: if people need to be encouraged to go to a founder school to be a founder, do we really want them anyway? \n\nShouldn't founders just be the \"true believers\"?\n\nNot if you believe startups are good for the world, then you want more.\n\nMilitary does OK: https://t.co/za3sOcyM5b Note: One bad rap schools (deservingly) get is they become gatekeepers in order to entrench their importance\n\nI'm not talking about building a licensing institution. No founder should be looked down upon for not going through such a program.\n\nBut the ones who want should get it. Another bad rap is they become excuses to actually build.\n\nThere's no substitute for actual founding\n\nIf such a program prevents people from building, or makes them feel they need the program as permission, it's a failure.\n\nSuccess is correlated w/ spurring new companies. VCs have been skeptical for the above reasons, but also b/c they want to be the educators. The more capable founders are, the less they'll need VCs\n\nBut they'll always need $, so they should view it as a complement\n\nStartup education has been democratized\n\nhttps://t.co/716W2MjBYI Would love to a focus on removing other bottlenecks preventing people from starting companies, structural ones that have nothing to do with ideas, co-founders, or motivations.\n\nhttps://t.co/EiaTTUWNhU @beondeck (among others) is building a founder school for ppl who want to be founders in the future\n\nExcited to see more pop up: the skills gained by such a program (&amp; more so by actually founding) are helpful no matter what you do\n\nhttps://t.co/qU60xv8Qbi\nhttps://t.co/sVMgdeeg1q One major goal of any founder school is to help turn founding a company from an opaque job to a clear job:\n\nhttps://t.co/rL5MG37bih ",

A good tradeoff, assuming it doesn't lead to complete disaster.\n\nOr alternatively, a barbell model.\n\nThousands of shards, a few big religions, and nothing in the middle.\n\nVR (or AR) isn't just a literal technology, it's also a metaphor. The metaphor might be bigger than the tech What about shared reality? Didn't we have it?\n\nNo, we had shared myth, where everyone was under the same delusions. \n\nIn the info age, you can't keep up the delusions anymore. \n\nBut the more info/data there is, the more arguments over what's true.\n\nGurri: https://t.co/AGHG17IrlL When all information was centralized &amp; you only ever knew a small group of ppl, you could spend enough time with people to collectively sense-make &amp; get on the same page.\n\nBut when you can talk to orders of magnitude more ppl in much more superficial ways, aligning is impossible. What else explains the need for reality entrepreneurs?\n\nReality itself is being blunted.\n\nLiberal wealthy societies have a fundamental contradiction: They try to reduce conflict &amp; protect people, yet their media is fundamentally obsessed with violence &amp; perversion. Schizophrenic. America solves this problem by allowing for the full range of human experience, but at the level of *virtual reality* only.\n\nIt's a contradiction between politics of safety and the aspiration towards extreme experiences.\n\nIn an effort to protect, we've stymied the vitality In other words, Trump provides America with the simulation of living through an incipient fascist dictatorship without actually delivering it\n\nSeattle &amp; Portland etc provide America w/ the simulation of living through the Maoist cultural revolution without actually delivering it You can tell that something is LARPing by the low body count.\n\nReal communists &amp; fascists kill millions of people.\n\nMuch of the war takes place on Twitter. Twitter makes you think it's the French Revolution. Even the worst of cancel culture is a cake walk in comparison. Maybe virtualism is just the end-result of liberalism.\n\nMakes sense that in a true marketplace of ideas, you'd end up with a long-tail of realities.\n\nLiberalism &amp; capitalism created an opening, &amp; social media fanned the flame, effectively creating a stock market of realities. Anytime you talk about communities bootstrapping their own realities, you risk devolving into cults.\n\nSo the Q is what's the community design that's most amenable to the equal &amp; full emancipate emancipation or empowerment of all the members involved, without devolving into cult? Bruno Macaes' unorthodox take is that post-truth era could be good.\n\nThe great thing about fantasy, the logic goes, is that everyone can have their own, whereas facts (or modernity) can be limiting &amp; even authoritarian in comparison.\n\nJust need to make fantasies that can work. Much of this was inspired or quoted from @MacaesBruno's book, \"History has Begun\", @jmrphy Hard Fork series &amp; recent podcast, and conversations with others.\n\nhttps://t.co/BJFQWlqbA5 \n\nhttps://t.co/93FwCoJluI\n\nhttps://t.co/a8QHGBA3A0 Obviously it could also be immensely bad.

The labor cost to build a home is actually\u00a0higher today\u00a0than it was in the 1960s. In California, just transactional efficiency isn't enough. Why? It actually raises price.\n\nYou also need construction productivity.\n\nIn particular, there've been promising advances in two areas: modular housing and so-called tiny homes. Real estate agents have a bit of a racket going\n\nIf you're selling a house, it's 3%. If you're buying a house, it's 3%. They legally can't take less, regardless of work needed\n\nWeirdly, they're incentivized for you to pay more for a house, rather than less. Should be the opposite https://t.co/O9Xe79jxgB Why does it currently suck to buy a house?\n\nAmong other reasons, if you're taking out a mortgage, you have to get approved, which can take 45 days. \n\nWhich means you can lose out on the house to someone who can pay right away, even if you were willing to pay more for it. https://t.co/P75pVKp4w9 Companies will buy &amp; sell homes on behalf of ppl\n\nFlyhomes buys the house *for* you. Perfect for supply constrained markets. (Seattle)\n\nOpendoor buys the house *from* you. Perfect for demand constrained markets. (Phoenix)\n\nReal estate agents can't b/c they don't have the cash. https://t.co/8zvIB9SFNn Other companies are changing what it means to own a home.\n\nDivvy for example, buys homes on behalf of aspiring home-owners and rents it to them for 3 years, and enables their rent payments to convert in equity positions in the home\n\nSide effect: \"No one pays to wash a rental car\" https://t.co/8uXNOurM6w Point allows you to sell a percentage of your house and use it to pay off all your high interest credit card debt, which improves your credit score, which lets you get a better credit card. https://t.co/GsMbJzEGy7 Residential real estate is 100 billion dollar market. Just off commissions.\n\neBay, which sells everything, is only makes ~9.5 billion dollars a year. Real Estate 1.0:\n\nZillow &amp; Trulia aggregated demand &amp; then became lead-gen businesses for real estate agents. Was sustaining, not disruptive, innovation\n\nFactors leading to more disruptive companies (Zillow change included!)\n\n1- New tech\n2- More capital\n3- On-demand expectations https://t.co/7kfqlYIwOj One reason real-estate hasn't been optimized to date, unlike, say, ride-sharing w/ Lyft &amp; Uber, is that people buy houses every ten years, vs taking Lyft/Uber multiple times a day. \n\nBut it's also the single most important &amp; costly transaction in most people's lives. To bring this back full-circle, many people struggle to move move b/c they can't buy a new house until they sell their old house out of cash constraints.\n\nThe easier we make it to sell &amp; buy homes, the more we can reduce artificial barriers to income mobility.\n\n/FIN\n\nAdd thoughts ",

If Daryl Davis can have civil conversations with KKK and help them abandon it, you can understand them. Engaging in respectful dialogue doesn't mean accepting their conclusions\n\nIt means understanding not just what they believe but also why they believe it\u2014in that process, maybe they\u2019ll come to understand your reasoning, or see that their reasoning is in error, or vice versa Attempt to re-express their position so clearly that your target says, \u201cThat's right. I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that way.\"\n\nAssure common goals, values, and points of agreement.\n\nMention what you've learned from them.\n\nOnly after this should you utter a word of rebuttal Make your goals of collaboration and understanding explicit.\n\nSay, \u201cI'm really curious what you believe and how you came to believe it, it might inform my own thinking on the topic.\"\n\nLead with curiosity and ask yourself: \"Why do they believe that?\" If you think their motives are off, lead with curiosity: \"Could you tell me more about where you\u2019re coming from on that so I can understand better?\"\n\nIf you think they question your motives, say: \"I may be off here. If something is wrong with my reasoning, please let me know.\" If you try to change their mind directly w/ facts, they'll probably double down.\n\nInstead get them to explain their epistemology--how they know what they know.

  "text": "What is Nietzsche's lasting influence on Nazi Germany?\n\nBrief summary of Stephen Hicks' \"Nietzsche and the Nazis\"\n\nhttps://t.co/rjjukKrhTL It may be hard to believe that the Nazis thought of themselves as idealists.\n\nWestern liberal democracies\u2014&amp; the freedom, equality, &amp; peace they provide\u2014are seen as good.\n\nBut was it obvious in the 1930s?\n\nDemocratic experiments were tried in ancient Greece and Rome. Both failed. At the time it wasn't obvious liberal democracies were superior. \n\nThe U.S. lasted only 90 years before it plunged into a brutal Civil War. \n\nIn the 1920s the U.S. is itself experiencing economic uncertainty and is shortly to plunge into its Great Depression. Nazism is collectivistic: it does not hold that individuals have their own lives to live and happiness to pursue. Rather, individuals should serve the general good, to which they subordinate their personal lives\n\nNazism tried to reconcile nationalism and socialism. the Nazis rejected cosmopolitanism, an ideal of Western liberals who believe that all humans are essentially the same wherever one travels in the world, and who believe that one should strive to be a citizen of the world. \n\nThe Nazis are nationalists, by contrast. The message was quite clear: You are not a private individual seeking profit or higher wages in a capitalist economy. You and your property belong in trust to the German people, and you have a duty to serve the public interest, even if it involves a personal sacrifice. That human beings are divided into collective groups that shape their identity. \n\nThat those collective groups are in a life and death competitive struggle with each other. \n\nThat any tactic is legitimate in the war of competing groups. That human beings are not individuals with their own lives to live but are servants of the state. \n\nThat the state should have total power over both the minds and bodies of its citizens and may dispose of them as If you believe wholeheartedly and passionately that your identity is found by merging yourself with your group\u2014* that your group is locked in a mortal, zero-sum conflict w/ other groups\u2014&amp; that reason is superficial &amp; that passion &amp; instinct drive the world\u2014what does that portend? Thinkers associated w/ revolutions:\n\nCommunist in Russia &amp; China - Marx\nFrench - Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nAmerican - John Locke\nNazi - Hegel, Fichte, some Marx, but mostly Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche was a nineteenth-century German philosopher famous for his worship of human potential &amp; for encouraging individuals to seek great heights &amp; make real their creative dreams. He is also famous for his absolute loathing of all things small, cowardly, or mediocre. For fans of Nietzsche, the idea that God is dead galvanizes every fiber of their being. They respond by feeling, both passionately &amp; solemnly: I will become the author. I will create. I will embrace the responsibility\u2014joyously. I will move beyond good and evil &amp; create new values Both religion and socialism thus glorify weakness and need. \n\nBoth recoil from the world as it is: tough, unequal, harsh. \n\nBoth flee to an imaginary future realm where they can feel safe. \n\nAnd both desperately seek someone to look after them\u2014whether it be God or the State. And where, asks Nietzsche, are the men of courage? Who is willing to stare into the abyss? Who can look a tiger in the eye without flinching? Every generation produces its   people who accept easily that life is brutal, but assert their strength to meet the challenge. The more we look at history, the more we are struck by the diversity of circumstances &amp; how dramatically beliefs about values have changed across time. \n\nWe once prized power &amp; looked down upon the humble and &amp; meek. Now the meek are the \u201cgood guys\u201d while the aggressive are \u201cevil We went from: \n\n- Be ambitious and bold, and seek your highest dream.\n- Seek great challenges, pleasures, &amp; go your own way in life\n- And when you accomplish something great, admire yourself for what you have done and indulge yourself in the rewards that greatness deserves. To: \n\n- The meek shall inherit the earth, and blessed are the poor. \n- Instead of seeking profit, one should sacrifice and give to charity. \n- Be aware of one\u2019s weaknesses and sins, and be ashamed and self-deprecating as a result. This has led to rise in Democracy. \n\nDemocracies tailor their policies to the majority\u2014not to the exceptional few who are radicals, trailblazers, and uncompromising risk-takers. But according to Nietzsche, the modern democracy itself based on this great inversion described above. Nietzsche also credits the Judeo-Christian tradition for its spiritual development\u2014its ability to focus inward &amp; stress self-discipline.\n\nHe wants to combine the physical vitality of the aristocratic masters w/ the spiritual ruthlessness of Christianity.\n\nCeasar w/ soul of Christ Nietzsche holds that reason is an artificial tool of weaklings\u2014those who need to feel safe and secure build fantasy orderly structures for themselves. \n\nInstead, instincts are the deepest parts of your nature\u2014and when you feel them strongly, nurture them and manifest them. Nietzsche views on Jews are often misappropriated.\n\nHe did blame them (&amp; Christians) for the great inversion valuing the weak over the strong, subverting greatness in his view\n\nHe still admires how well they've both prospered despite this and flourished amid the great inversion. Differences between Nietzsche and the Nazis: \n\n1.\u00a0 Nietzsche did not believe any race was superior. \n2. Nietzsche did not think Germans were culturally superior.\n3.\u00a0Nietzsche wasn't Anti-Semitic . \n4. Nietzsche saw strong parallels between Judaism and Christianity Similarities between Nietzsche &amp; the Nazis: \n\n1. Both were strongly collectivistic\n2. Both saw see zero-sum conflict as inescapable and as fundamental to the human condition. \n3. Both downplay reason &amp; prize instincts\n4. Both are anti-democratic, anti capitalistic, &amp; anti-liberal The Nazis stood for collectivism. The opposite of that is a philosophy of individualism that recognizes individual rights.\n\nThe Nazis stood for instinct as one\u2019s basic guides in life. The opposite of that is a philosophy that has a healthy confidence in the power of reason. After detailing the atrocities of the Nazis as well as the underlying philosophies of the Nazi party (and contrasting them with Nietzsche's philosophies), Hicks ends the book provocatively:\n\n\"The Nazis knew what they stood for. Do we?\" ",

Ambitious or balanced? Build or protest? Self-sacrifice or self-care? How would Steve Jobs have been pathologized / diagnosed today? \n\nWould we have encouraged him or discouraged him?\n\nKobe was not for this \"everyone gets a trophy culture\" or work-life harmony (no friends, by his own admission). Don't get me started on Jordan. \n\ne.g Mamba mentality https://t.co/xULXY4aR7p Ambition requires sacrifice. \n\nAre we encouraging people to take sacrifice, or are we discouraging them by diagnosing, pathologizing, or ridiculing them.\n\nOr are we telling them they can have it all, and even if they can't, everyone wins a trophy, because you're all special Sometimes there\u2019s the paradox that ambition might not be great for you in the short term, but good for you long-term.\n\nOr that sometimes it might not even be good for you long-term, but great for the commons.\n\nMost people who've overworked but achieved any success wouldn't trade. What is the state of ambition today?\n\nAre ppl encouraged as much as possible to \"build\"?\n\nIs the next Steve Jobs focused on building Apple today? \n\nIs the next Zuck at Harvard today gonna make the next Facebook?

  "text": "Some quick thoughts on the tensions between liberalism and nationalism\ud83d\udc47 Liberalism and nationalism are built on a very different assumption about human nature:\n\nLiberalism is predicated on the assumption that we're all initially individuals &amp; we then unite &amp; form social groups\n\nWe form social contracts, but we're fundamentally individuals, logic goes Nationalism, on the other hand, assumes that we are first and foremost social animals. \n\nAs we grow, we carve out room for individualism, but it's often subordinate to our tribalism. We belong to groups, tribes, nations, etc. Liberalism is predicated on the assumption that we have powerful abilities to reason, but we cannot reach universal agreement on the big Q's about life. We go to war over these disagreements\n\nSo, liberalism privileges individual rights as to help us collaborate when no one agrees Liberalism has evolved over time.\n\nInitially the emphasis was mainly on \"negative rights\" (free speech, due process).\n\nThen it evolved to \"positive rights\" (e.g. equality)\n\nNegative rights are positive sum, positive rights not so much.\n\nMore context: https://t.co/kig6uUPlfW Tenets of nationalism:\n\n- You're born into a social group called a nation.\n- Each nation should have its own state.\n- Each state should have its own sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nNationalism is more powerful than civilizations.\n\nThere used to be broader empires, but no more. Many Americans misunderstand the pull of nationalism, and might dismiss the description of it as inherent in people. \n\nSince we're a liberal state and the liberal ideology is so deeply baked into our DNA, we gravitate to thinking about liberalism above all else. Tension between liberalism &amp; nationalism:\n\n(Progressive) Liberalism is about universalism. Everyone has the same rights. That value system is the only thing that's not diverse about liberalism's aims.\n\nNationalism is about sovereignty. This is our people, our land, our rules, etc This leads liberalism to want to spread universally, as that is the best way to operate.\n\nThis ruffles nationalists who want sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nLiberalism praise rights and universalism above all. Nationalists praise sovereignty &amp; particularism above all. ",

More like 10% on it setting up the basics (\"set it &amp; forget it\")\n\nWhereas referrals can work day one Usually don't like relying on paid acquisition initially, if you can avoid it. Most big &amp; durable companies didn't rely on it\n\nAvoiding it builds the discipline of figuring out viral growth mechanics\n\nUnless you prove that if you spend $1, you get $5, &amp; you don't have high churn. B2B:\n\nAre you selling into an individual decision maker who then is going to scale the product out inside the organization? \n\nOr is it a bottoms up type product where one part of the org adopts it organically (often free) &amp; then seeds usage inside of the rest of the org. Metrics that matter:\n\nEarly on, quality over quantity metrics. (e.g. retention)\n\n50% or 10% long term retention matters more in the beginning than user growth rate.\n\nDAU matters if you require specific use cases\n\nIt's less \"can this get users\" &amp; more \"can it keep them...+ paying\" Cohort analysis:\n\nIsolate users by cohort so you can analyze how behaviors change as time goes on and as you change the product.\n\nYou can identify if there are natural attrition points (\"graduation rates\") and if your changes unlock new behavior. Calculating LTV w/ only a few months of data isn't very constructive.\n\nWhat people are getting at is \"How will this product grow over time\"\n\nSo you want to say \"Here's what it'll look like at scale, here's what our flywheel looks like, etc\n\nhttps://t.co/f91Z1ENsNB Payback periods sometimes better than LTV/CAC\n\nMeaning how if I spend $1, how quickly do I get it back in not just revenue but contribution margin\n\n&amp; the reason for that is it's hard to build compounding growth on a paid channel w/o a ton of $ unless you have fast payback periods What you're really trying to ask yourself is \"can I reinvest these dollars into more growth?\" \n\nAnd if it takes you a year or two to get those dollars back then you're counting on another source of capital to fund your growth. Companies over-focus too much on month-over-month growth before nailing the product (e.g retention)\n\nPlus, in the beginning, the #s are so small you convince yourself it's working. But if retention isn't there it won't continue. Focusing exclusively on 10% MOM growth might force you to over index on acquisition when you should be focusing on nailing the product\n\nIt might make it hard to tell the difference between real growth &amp; fake growth\n\n/FIN. \n\nThx to @far33d @JeffChang30 for convos that led to this ",

  "text": "Here some my favorite quotes from Slate Star Codex:\n\nFor folks new to SSC: https://t.co/yacqUISzAY\n\nhttps://t.co/aPAnTst7Gg\n\nThe author seems like one of the great public intellectuals most people have never heard of, outside of the milieu in which he is revered. Advice is often a placebo, but not in the way that you'd expect:\n\n\"High status person is willing to listen to my problems. That means society considers my problems important and considers me important. It means my problems are okay to have and I\u2019m not in trouble for having them\" Does labeling a person as depressed make people feel better, b/c now they know it's not their fault?\n\nOr does it make ppl depressed about how depressed they are, &amp; then go \u201cThere\u2019s that depression again, guess this means I\u2019m not getting any better\u201d &amp; become depressed about that? If you feel like a burden, know that you can\u2019t always trust your brain\n\nIf System I is broken, you need to call in System II to route around the distorted cognition so you can understand at least intellectually that you\u2019re wrong.\n\nSystem 1 is not the most trustworthy arbiter The term \"toxic\" is reflexive: \n\nAccusing someone of being something makes it more likely that they turn into that thing\n\nIf you keep accusing your (innocent) partner of being angry &amp; suspicious of you, eventually they'll get tired &amp; become angry &amp; suspicious that something's up Imagine Christians suffer a dramatic loss in prestige such that a cross is equivalent to a confederate flag.\n\nThe agreeable Christians suddenly flee, and only the disagreeable diehards are left.\n\n\"See, Christians are dogmatic!\" \n\nThis is what's happened to free speech advocates. Another dynamic:\n\nEvery time we use free speech to justify some unpopular idea, the unpopular idea becomes a little more tolerated,\u00a0&amp; free speech becomes a little less popular\n\nEvery time some group invokes free speech to say controversial stuff, they\u2019re drawing from the commons HL Mencken once said that \u201cthe trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one\u2019s time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.\u201d The nightmare scenario is that \u201cfree speech\u201d goes the way of \u201cfamily values\u201d\u2014a seemingly uncontroversial concept gets so tarnished by its association with conservative ideas that it becomes impossible to mention without outing yourself as some kind of far-right weirdo. (Too late) Insisting that others are deliberately trying to hurt you frees you from any obligation to do the hard work of trying to understand other ppl, or the hard work of changing minds, or the hard work of questioning your own beliefs, or or even remembering that we're on the same team. Principle of Charity:\n\nYou should always assume your ideological opponents\u2019 beliefs must make sense from their perspective\n\nIf you can\u2019t even conceive of a position you oppose being tempting to someone, you don\u2019t understand it\n\n\u201cAlmost no one is evil; almost everything is broken\u201d Moloch:\n\nIn any complex multi-person system, the system acts according to its own chaotic incentives that don\u2019t necessarily correspond to what\u00a0any individual within the system wants.\n\nhttps://t.co/l1bQC7pPzP Why do women too have instincts towards polyamory (and&amp;not just men?)\n\nMayb: \"women genetically \"want\" both to keep an alpha male faithful &amp; to\u00a0capture maximum genetic variation in their offspring.\n\nthus, It's optimal for Jane to have 3 kids by Tarzan &amp; 1 by a romantic stranger.\" Proving too much:\n\nWhen you challenge an argument b/c, in addition to proving its intended conclusion, it also proves false conclusions.\n\nWhen someone says, \"you can't be an atheist b/c you can't disprove God\", respond \"yeah, but you can't disprove Bigfoot. \n\nIt proves too much. You can make diff groups support diff things by changing narrative:\n\ne.g Making Red Tribe support climate change\n\n- Renewable energy is triumph of capitalism\n- Communist China &amp; Russia are threatening our planet &amp; thus U.S. supremacy. They want global warming.\n- You're not racist What is the \u201cspirit of the First Amendment\u201d? \n\nBad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Does not get doxxing. Does not get harassment. Does not get fired from job. Gets counterargument. Should not be hard. A good response to an argument is one that addresses an idea; a bad argument is one that silences it\n\nYour success addressing an idea depends on how good the idea is\u2014Your success silencing depends on how powerful you are &amp; how many pitchforks &amp; torches you can get on short notice If you want to stress test a censorship system, design one &amp; then hand it over to your worst enemy &amp; let them run it on you.\n\nIf that still gives you the outcome you want, then fine\n\n\"Universalize as if the process you use to universalize would itself become universal.\" If you try to hold the Koch Brothers \u201caccountable\u201d for muddying climate change waters, they'll laugh in your face.\n\nIf you try to hold closeted gay ppl \u201caccountable\u201d for promoting gay rights, it will be very easy &amp; you'll successfully ruin their lives.\n\nDo you want it like this? Lord Byron wrote of his political philosophy:\n\nI wish men to be free\u2028\nAs much from mobs as kings; from you as me\n\nAll I can say to that is \u2013 it\u2019s a package deal, people. \n\nEither promote good social norms, or be destroyed by the bad ones when the tide turns against you. \u201cThat other monkey has status that should be\u00a0my\u00a0status!\u201d \u2013 nobody ever went broke peddling that. How causes become tribes:\n\n1. Let\u2019s get together to do X\u2028\n2. Let\u2019s get together to do X, and have drinks afterwards\u2028\n3. Let\u2019s get together to discuss things from an X-informed perspective\u2028\n4. Let\u2019s get together to discuss the sorts of things that interest people who do X How causes become tribes\n\n\u20285. Let\u2019s get together to discuss how the sort of people who do X are much better than the sort of people who do Y.\n\u20286. Dating site for the sort of people who do X\u2028\n7. Oh god, it was so annoying, she spent the whole date talking abt X.\u2028\n8. X? What X? Elements of his ideal language:\n\n\u2013 It follows\u00a0E-Prime\u00a0in throwing out \u201cto be\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Assertions require probability statements (\"90% confident\")\n\n\u2013 Assertions about plurals require quantifiers (\"all\" \"at least one\")\n\n\u2013 \u201cShould\u201d always requires a following \u201conly if\u2026\u201d statement On making ideal city religious:\n\nI made it religious because I really really like religion, except for the part where it\u2019s wrong.\n\nI like how all the studies show that religious belief improves physical health, mental health, charitable giving, &amp; a host of other useful values. Contrarianism is this incredibly fragile &amp; precious art which needs to be kept alive for when it's needed.\n\nCultivating contrarianism is a lot like owning a gun\u2014u get a heck of a lot of opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot, but also very occasionally 1 opp to save ur life. Why socialism doesn't work:\n\nManagers employ workers, but workers want to slack off or line their pockets\n\nCentral planners employ managers but managers want to slack or line their pockets\n\nPublic employs central planners, but central planners want to slack or line their pockets Lottery of Fascinations:\n\nSome people are motivated by business or science or art.\n\nOthers are motivated by gossip or drama or trivia.\n\nLuck of the draw. What happened to New Atheists?\n\nThey were useful to democrats to embarrass Bush, but then when Christians faded in power &amp; Muslims became core to democrats' strategy, New Atheism suddenly became inconvenient to democrat strategy.\n\nMany later became Social Justice advocates. But there\u2019s a risk that postmodernism collapses into ppl ignoring any facts they disagree with, arguing that facts are mutable products of hostile power structures trying to perpetuate themselves. \n\nAnd by \u201cthere\u2019s a risk\u201d, I mean \u201cthis has been obviously happening for decades\u201d. Re: criticizing Social Justice, do better than the pseudo-Nietzschean \u201cStop crying, babies!\u201d.\n\nAll this is doing is granting social justice activists their most dubious claim: that they are trying to use their ideology as a shield for themselves rather than a sword against others Ironic application of post-modernism on itself:\n\nPostmodernism says that facts often get reframed to support the powerful. So it\u2019s inevitable that post-modernism itself going to be twisted to support the powerful. (e.g. both cultural Marxists, &amp; far-right media). \"Postmodern meta-epistemology, as I call it, is compatible with rationality (&amp; rationalism, &amp; empiricism).\n\nIt just contends that \u201ctruth\u201d is an unstable concept that depends on a language game to mean, which means there is no ultimate guarantor of what truth per se is.\n\nDisagree\" Assumptions for discussion:\n\n1. Are you trying to present the correct balance btw positions (\u201cjudge mode\u201d) or present 1 side of a case (\u201clawyer mode\u201d)?\n\n2. Do you mean exactly what you say (\u201cthe pointing finger\u201d) or are you groping towards a hard-to-explain concept (\u201cthe moon\u201d)? Assumptions (cont):\n\n3. Are you trying to describe how things work in the real world, or the underlying mechanism beneath them?\n\n4. Are you declaring something is definitely correct (\u201ctheory\u201d), or bringing it to ppl's attention as an idea worthy of consideration (\u201chypothesis\u201d)? Barely even scratching the surface here. There's TONS of stuff I'm not including, across many different disciplines. \n\nGo spend some hours (or years) reading his work:\n\nAs a place to start, I also enjoyed this collection of favorite posts by @alexeyguzey:\n\nhttps://t.co/pzxJangk4V ",

Schools are outdated:\n\nToday, the world is dynamic so people need to be entrepreneurial &amp; continuously re-learning\n\nThe whole education model needs to flip as a result. From \"Push\" to \"Pull\". \n\nFrom you tell me the right answer to ask the right question and then find the answer. Batch process made sense in industrial era where you didn't have technology to customize learning.\n\nIn factory model, you'd teach to median &amp; lose the kids at the top and   bottom\n\nNow we have the technology to enable personalization at scale w/ community support, to catch both Excellence vs Genius\n\nSchools do an excellent job of training for *excellence* = where there are clearly bounded domains, and it\u2019s known exactly what has to be done to be successful.\n\nBut terrible at \"Genius\"\u2014innovation no one can predict. School kills the creativity out of them.

Internet education was isolated. Now we're making it social again, but w/ internet scale. What's why now for 3rd wave? Tooling &amp; culture\n\nTooling: Synchronous instruction required A+ video &amp; interactive functionality.\n\ne.g. Lambda wouldn't thrive as easily without Zoom &amp; Slack. \n\nCulture: Young parents grew up w/ Google &amp; Youtube &amp; are shocked to see no change.

What's old is new again:\n\nHomeschool: Before public schools, elite were homeschooled.\n\nP2P learning: Before grades, there were one-room school houses where kids taught other kids.\n\nContinuous learning: Apprenticeships used to be very common. Learning forever was the norm.

When AI can contribute to knowledge loop\u2014what makes humans special then?\n\nQualia: when I look at this orange chair over there, I have a feeling of what it feels like to be looking at an orange chair\n\nWe get the brain at constituent level, but not emergent phenomena level. Every age of humanity has a defining scarcity.\n\nHumanity then invents tech that shifts that scarcity.\n\nAgriculture solved for food, scarcity shifted to arable land\n\nEnlightenment gave us industrial age, scarcity shifted from land to capital\n\nScarcity in knowledge age is attention Change from forager to agrarian:\n\nMigratory -&gt; sedentary\nPolygamous -&gt; monogamous\nFlat societies -&gt; hierarchical\nAnimistic religions -&gt; god religions\n\nChange from agrarian to industrial:\n\nCountry -&gt; city\nLarge families -&gt; nuclear families\nCommons -&gt; private property The need for food didn't go away. We just filled it in more efficient ways.\n\nSame thing for capital. It's not like we no longer need to build houses and cars and so forth. It's just that we can build sufficient housing and cars for everybody overtime. Fire can be used to cook, but it can be used to burn down. \n\nAI can be used to diagnose disease, but it can also manipulate people.\n\nAgriculture made Athenian democracy possible, but also dark ages.\n\nIndustrial society made democracy possible, but it also made Stalin possible. Digital machines are different from industrial machines in two ways:\n\nZero Marginal Cost &amp; Universality.\n\nEconomics wasn't built on zero marginal cost, a lot of theories break down. \n\nThe constraint in the last one was capital, this one is attention. Ppl used to have a clear path: go to college, get a job, have a long standing career, have a place nicer than parents.\n\nNo longer. We don't yet have a replacement path for people wanting predictability/stability.  MAGA is evidence.\n\nNeed fundamental shifts, not just incremental. Capitalism it does an amazing job at turning financial capital into physical capital, which is why we have all these extraordinary capabilities\n\nOf course, many people are still poor, albeit less. But as a society, we have enough to feed people. It's a distribution problem. Capitalism works well when you can have markets that can have prices. \n\nBut what is the price for you to discover your purpose in life? \n\nNo market mechanism will solve that. \n\nThat's an attention problem that we need to allocate attention to without a market mechanism. Collective action problems:\n\nWhat is the prize for humanity being able to deflect an incoming asteroid detected? (Or prepare for a possible pandemic?) \n\nThere is no market mechanism that will allocate collective attention to this problem. Solutions to our problems need to come from knowledge age paradigm, not industrial age.\n\nGov't providing job - industrial age\n\nGov't providing UBI - knowledge age\n\nWhat will people do instead of jobs?\n\nResearch\nSelf-care\nFamily/friends\nEnvironment\nMake art\nCultivate knowledge Role of capital in knowledge age?\n\nin 1780, ~80% of human attention in the US was dedicated just to feeding ourselves. Today, that's like sub 5%,.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of human attention is on economic activity. Capital will still have a role, but maybe we can shift it to ~20%. Types of freedoms\n\nEconomic - ~UBI of $800 a month will let ppl get out of job loop\n\nInformational - Data sovereignty \n\nPsychological freedom - no longer being slaves to whatever stimuli are thrown at us. Network effects are too strong -- they have turned normal distributions into power laws\n\nHard q's:\n\nWhat's the right governance for those networks? \n\nWhat is the power that I should have as a participant in those networks relative to the owners and operators of the network? \"shift the balance of power back towards or some of it anyhow, back to the edge, we need to figure out how to give each and every one of us computers that we control, and that lets us interact with the other systems through computation that we control ourselves. \" Everything should be an API.\n\nI shouldn't have to ask Facebook or Twitter for permission to program Facebook or Twitter, I should just be able to do it.\n\nEverything is programmable, everything is composable, everything is remixable. e.g. If Amazon had it...I could have powerful bots operated on my behalf scanning Amazon, comparing Amazon to three other sites automatically, it would give startup sites a real opportunity b/c machines could check 2nd sites on my behalf.

Physical (e.g. landline telephones)\n2. Protocol (e.g. Ethernet)\n3. Personal Utility (e.g. iMessage, WhatsApp)\n4. Personal (e.g. Facebook)\n5. Market Network (e.g. HoneyBook, AngelList)\n6.

Bandwagon (e.g. Slack, Apple)\"\n\nhttps://t.co/FMyUW8VzAH Typically, the higher the density of a network, the more powerful its network effects are.\n\nFocus on the \"red-hot-center\" of a network or marketplace \u2014 the densest, highest activity part.\n\nFocus on the product features &amp; language to get other users to behave more like that group. https://t.co/Rn7qDNg6ZL Critical mass: The critical mass of a network refers to the point at which the value produced by the network exceeds the value of the product itself and of competing products. This can happen at different times depending on the type of a network. https://t.co/mjbzhoosze Evolution of network effects:\n\n1st: Broadcast: network value is proportional to its viewers (e.g Yahoo)\n\n2nd: Metcalfe's law: value is proportional to N squared (eg FB)\n\n3rd: Reed\u2019s law: value can scale exponentially b/c of subgroups formed (e.g vertical networks) https://t.co/npWgggtmsm @sarahtavel stresses importance of users completing \"Core Actions\"\n\n- The more you use the product, the better the experience gets\n\n- The more you use the product, the harder it is to leave\n\n- Conversely, you don't want your product to be easy to switch\n\nhttps://t.co/UlR5CR78ae Real Identity strengthens network effects.\n\nPeople say Facebook beat Myspace because FB leveraged real identity.\n\nPer Sarah's theory above, when you put your real name onto some social economy (\"followers\" \"friends\"), it becomes harder to leave. https://t.co/5100Lae5nH Network effects are important because they are the best form of defensibility, and thus value creation, in the digital world (the three other major defensibilities are brand, embedding, and scale).\n\nMost big businesses have network effects, but not all. Defensibility without network effects:\n\n- Scale enables negotiating leverage (e.g MoviePass), amortization of fixed assets (Netflix), &amp; product density (LimeBike)\n\n- Brand (e.g. Coinbase)\n\n- High switching cost b/c embedding, habit, or personal data\n\nhttps://t.co/NfmsSN6cww Economies of scale: As well-run companies get bigger, their per unit production costs get cheaper\n\nIn other words, more users means greater volume, which means cheaper prices from suppliers, which means lower prices for customers, which means higher conversion rates for ads, etc https://t.co/m8mybl7XG3 Hidden network effects\n\n- Slow Networks: companies where network effects take a while to build (e.g. Lambda School, YC)\n\n- Latent Networks: companies that first focus on single player experiences before introducing multi-player (e.g. Roam Research)\n\nhttps://t.co/SYvSAG9His Network effects that peak \n\nSocial Networks: after a certain point, turns into reverse network effect\n\nRidesharing: Once multiple platforms hit relative liquidity, users don't care (supply commoditized)\n\nOther reverse nfx: https://t.co/azSKwJJ3x0\n\nhttps://t.co/dfzdTNSJSM Marketplaces should reduce search costs &amp; make matching easier.\n\nWhen it doesn't, each additional user causes more challenge in discovery, resulting in decision fatigue (e.g dating apps) \u201cHomogeneous supply\u201d marketplaces hit an asymptote in nfx, where value to users plateaus w greater market depth (LimeBike)\n\nFor heterogeneous marketplaces, there is no asymptote because every node on the supply side is different and potentially can add greater value (e.g. Airbnb) https://t.co/R9aAs3VNJ6 How to avoid multi-tenanting (users using multiple products, e.g. Lyft &amp; Uber):\n\nLayer on functionality that can obviate the need for another product.

Counter: If you're not sure whether you need an exec, don't hire one.\n\nHire an executive only when it's clear that you need one: when you need to build out an org, accelerate hiring, and you need to scale &amp; up-level your processes. Know what greatness looks like:\n\n- Aggressively meet world-class people at the position, regardless of where they are, so you can calibrate accordingly. They'll likely be happy to help you if you're doing well\n\n- Use gathered data to write specs for the role &amp; determine  criteria What do execs need to be able to do:\n\n- Build organizations, often from scratch.\n\n- Also be primary individual contributors.\n\n- Act like an owner &amp; be a team player Understand whether role is value protecting or value creating, and spec accordingly.\n\nCFO at SaaS company = value protection\n\nCFO at Opendoor = value creation\n\nValue protecting, hire for slope\n\nValue creation, hire for experience\n\nhttps://t.co/i8A4tXWvpK Hire the best person for the next 9 months, not the next 3 yrs.\n\ni.e.:\n\nIf you find someone who's not good now but good 3 yrs from now, don't hire them. They won't or can't do what you need now\n\nIf you find someone who's good now but not in 3 yrs, hire them. You'll figure it out. Promote from within when you can.\n\nIt's how you keep great people who would otherwise leave for better opportunities elsewhere. It also shows there is upward mobility in the org.\n\nYou can trust them. They already know your culture and have team buy-in. Be careful hiring a big company executive for a startup. \n\nThe skill sets required for a big company exec vs a startup exec are very different. \n\nEven the best big company execs often don't know what to do once they arrive at a startup. If you know what you're doing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about 50/50. \n\nThat is, about 50% of the time you'll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person.\n\nIf you don't know what you're doing, it'll be way worse. Use an exec firm for sourcing, but don't outsource your evaluation, selling, or knowing what you need in the 1st place.\n\nNo one wants to pay $100K to a search firm, but a great exec hire pays back orders of magnitude more than that\n\nAvg time of search is 137 days, so start early! Q's to ask:\n\nIf you were CEO at your last co, what would you do differently? (You want them to be an owner).\n\nWhat's the business equation of your last company? (You want them to be strategic)\n\n\"Who are the people you'd bring along with you?\" (You want them to be a talent magnet) Best interviews are a mix of buying and selling.\n\nBuying - Asking Q's, digging in\n\nSelling - Painting a vision, expressing interest in specific candidate for a specific core part of that vision.\n\nQualify early: Why are they leaving? Why are they potentially interested in joining? On Compensation:\n\nBring it up in the beginning briefly to assure you're in the same ball park, and then don't bring it up again until the end when they're sold.\n\n\"If we're meant to work together, don't want comp to be the reason why we don't.\" After you hire them:\n\n- Manage your executives. Even if you're 20 and they're 70. (e.g. Weekly 1:1s)\n\n- But don't micro-manage (unless temporarily). If you feel urged to, it might mean you don't trust them. Dig into that.\n\n- Ask people under them semi-regularly how they're doing. When should you fire an executive\n\n- When you no longer trust them to build their org &amp; feel compelled to micro-manage.\n\n- Judged by output of their org.

  "text": "According to Structural Demographic Theory, a major problem we currently face is that we have too many elites, not enough productivity growth to support them, and, as a result, we get major political &amp; social breakdowns.\n\nThread \ud83d\udc47 Remember Malthus?\n\nHe was worried that population would increase faster than tech could support it. \n\nWe think of him as wrong today thx to agriculture and other tech, but that's not all.\n\nAfter all, population can grow 3% a year, doubling every 25 yrs. Gotta be something else. Two kinds of checks on population growth, positive &amp; negative.\n\nPositive checks are things that kill people (e.g. war, famine, disease)\n\nNegative checks are things that slow birth rate (e.g. when people get poorer, they tend to marry less and have less kids) Interestingly, once there are downswings in population, it takes a bit before they rise again\n\nThere's another process involved that leads to extended downswings: Elite Overproduction\n\nBacking up: When there are too many people, food is scarce, but jobs too, causing wages to fall A fall in wages are bad for workers, but good for elites: they can hire more workers for the same amount of $.\n\nWhen elites are better off, they are likely to marry earlier &amp; have bigger families\n\nSo when ordinary people are struggling due to overpopulation, the elite is booming. So the amount of elites take up a bigger fraction of overall population.\n\nThe problem w/ this expansion of the elite is that society only has room for a certain amount.\n\nAs the elite expands, there's growing pressure to find roles for them, so that they can keep their lifestyles. The state steps in to provide the excess elite with positions appropriate for their status.\n\nAnd that of course costs money because they need salaries sufficient to support elite lifestyles.\n\nA huge increase in # of elites means huge increase in govt expenses to fill these roles. As the elite continues to expand and the state struggles to find roles for them all, you get an intense competition for these positions.\n\nMany elites lose out on $ &amp; status they expected to get, making them very angry and leading them to turn on each other in intra-elite conflict A visible sign of this is an emphasis on credentialing.\n\nIn the old days when most of the elite youth could expect to inherit their parents wealth &amp; status, they didn't bother to go to university. \n\nBut w/ over-expansion, they now fight for credentials to separate them. Overpopulation isn't the only way we get an expansion of elite.\n\nThe American Dream is another way, the idea that anyone can earn their way to the elite.\n\nGlobalization amplifies this significantly.\n\nThe internet even more so. Now the whole world is competing to be an elite. Revolutions don't occur b/c masses are poor &amp; angry.\n\nThe elite control the army, so they can keep down the masses.\n\nRevolutions occur when there's intra elite competition.\n\nLeading to a counter elite, who, feeling entitled to $ they won't get, want to ensure others won't either. If you want to explain when social breakdowns occur, you need to look at 3 things (Political Stress Index):\n\n1- Mass mobilization potential (food shortages and falling wages)\n\n2- Elite mobilization potential (over-expansion and competition for status) \n\n3-  State fiscal distress More on state fiscal distress: \n\nAs state needs to spend more on elite, it has a hard time raising taxes b/c poor are also needy.\n\nIt can't afford to keep the elite happy and alleviate hunger and suppress unrest, and these problems of funding the state contribute to its collapse. To summarize:\n\nPopulation expands until it reaches the Malthusian limit.\n\nThis means wages fall &amp; labor is cheap, which leads to high mass mobilization potential.\n\nOverpopulation also leads to elite over-expansion and thus intra-elite competition. This leads to increased state expenditure to take care of elites, which means they need to raise taxes at the same time that the masses are poorer and *they* also need more govt services\n\nIt ends in breakdown &amp; population collapse, taking you back to underpopulation &amp; small elite Peter Turchin has also written a book applying the theory to the United States. American Civil War fits this theory\n\nStructural Demographic Theory used to take 2 centuries, but now takes 150 years, which means U.S. is getting pretty close to political breakdown &amp; social calamity. This analysis may seem strange.\n\nIsn't it a problem that rich people (&amp; everyone) are having too *few* kids? \n\nThe bigger problem is that productivity growth isn't rising enough to support their growth relative to overall population growth. Humans landed on the moon 50 yrs ago. But spaceflight remains a marginal activity with just a few astronauts in space at a time. \n\nCompare that w/ how in 50 yrs you went from the first powered aircraft to a global airline industry, already carrying 10s of millions of ppl a year. If we had continued to develop spaceflight and lunar exploration, that would have created lots of jobs, as well as opened up new resources, including abundant solar energy and metals and other valuable materials on the moon. And that would have absorbed the increase in population Signals of elite overexpansion: University attendance.\n\nIn UK since 1990, population increased by 15%, but the # of students increased by almost 100%.\n\nin 1990, American Law school grads had even distribution of salaries, but by 2000 there was a separation into winners &amp; losers. Both far leftists &amp; far rightists comprise the counter-elite.\n\nThey consider themselves entitled to elite privileges, but the state can't absorb them. \n\nAnd since they seem destined to remain outside privilege, oppose it: If they can't be a part of it, they want to destroy it. Because the cycle isn't over yet, we should expect a full blown political crisis, &amp; then a general breakdown and reset.\n\nEither a positive check (increase in death rate) and/or a negative check (decrease in birth rate)\n\nOne solution is economic growth: https://t.co/ghXx8nq8Dc https://t.co/tiHgVcsidm ",

  "text": "Some takeaways from conversations w/ @jasoncrawford, @ArtirKel, and @Ben_Reinhardt on progress, particularly on how 1) funding models, 2) regulation, and 3) culture influence progress \ud83d\udc47 1- Funding Models:\n\nThere are a lot of different funding models (NIH grants, DARPA...)\n\nA lot of research is done in universities, yet it's a relatively new phenomenon.\n\nThere was a golden era for corporate research w/ Bell Labs &amp; Xerox, but then &amp; gov't stepped in. The US famously doesn't have a national coordinated innovation policy. \n\nIn some ways this is a good thing, since means there is more diversity of thought and funding, more opportunities for someone to say \"yes\" to scientists and fund their projects. That said, some people believe our funding sources (e.g. NIH) have become way too centralized, &amp; if we could have just more decentralized versions, we'd have more creativity\n\nBeyond decentralization, need uncorrelated work to maximize chances of discovery\n\nhttps://t.co/zfVAGyXQcO It might be better to break down the NIH into smaller units, or distribute more who makes decisions over the money.\n\nWithout competition between different approaches, how would we know what works best?\n\nOne man's nonsense might be the building block for tomorrow man's cancer cure Think of it as a few tiny Manhattan Projects, maybe 20-200M$ each, way bigger than an academic grant and potentially fundable by philanthropists.\n\nPeople in these orgs wouldn't just aim to publish papers or get tenure, but they'd have specific goals and well-defined metrics. At the same time, it's nice to have the idea of \"no-strings attached\" to enable people to take risks in research without fear of. looking dumb.\n\nImagine scientists getting funded to do anything they want for the next 10 years, no matter what. Problem: scientists spend up to 50% of their time applying for grants\n\nFast Grants seem to show that it is possible to go fast while funding high quality research\n\nUltimately money has to come from somewhere, and any incentives have tradeoffs\n\nhttps://t.co/3URA9RaeSG B/c at the end of the day, we want funding mechanisms to be fair and accountable.\n\nBut anytime you have a fair and accountable process,\nthere's there's going to be a lot of paperwork and diligence  that needs to go along with it as well as gameifiable metrics . If we could change anything about academia?\n\n- Get rid of peer review\n- Get rid of accountability around grants\n- Get rid of departments\n- Get rid of administrators\n- Breaking research out of academia\n\nIf this is controversial, blame @Ben_Reinhardt not me.  :P 2: Regulation\n\nWe've accumulated a bureaucratic, regulatory state\n\nAny time there's a disaster, we start adding rules\n\nThe intent is good, but the cure's sometimes worse than the disease\n\nFast forward 100 years after FDA, &amp; now it costs well over $1B to develop a successful drug Anecdotally, China seems to regulate technologies several years after introducing them\n\nWhat if we did the same?\n\nWe'll regulate technologies, but we need to actually see what their effects are first\n\nWe'll thoroughly warn customers of risks etc, but let them opt in or out of it If you look at the history of technology, most technologies came with new risks; most of them needed new safety mechanisms to be invented with it.\n\nWhen we invented the X-ray, for example we also realized it could be harmful for our health. Safety concerns are real, but we need to understand there are always tradeoffs to regulation. \n\nWe need to acknowledge that there is a tradeoff between safety and speed, efficiency, progress, and long term breakthroughs. 3- Culture:\n\nThe idea of progress itself is a relatively new\n\nBefore then, most cultures had the opposite idea of ancestor worship: that our ancestors were the greatest people who ever lived, that all the important knowledge was revealed to them, &amp; all we should do is study them. It was understandable back in the Middle Ages to look at the pyramids, or the ruins left from the ancient Romans &amp; believe they were the peak of civilization\n\nAncestor worship had to be challenged and overturned to have the scientific &amp; industrial revolutions &amp; be forward looking Compare Chinese &amp; U.S. sci-fi:\n\nIn China, they show enormous geo-engineering projects\n\nIt's an indication of the ambition to do enormous projects form the country\n\nIn the U.S. it's mostly dystopian stuff (e.g. Black Mirror)\n\nThis effects what careers people go into Stagnation?\n\nPeople say we've had a lot of progress in the world of bits, but not a lot in the world of atoms.\n\nIsn't it just naturally how progress goes? We don't make a lot of progress in every area at every time.\n\nWe used to have progress in multiple spaces at the same time. The way we get exponential growth over long periods of time is by piling S-curves on top of each other, by jumping to a new S-curve as soon as one starts to slow down.\n\nWe need clarity around how we find new S-curves, how many are going on at once, how big are they overall, etc Is science slowing down?\n\nSome fields are growing at a good pace (life sciences), others are stagnant (physics)\n\nBut overall it seems it's slowing down. \n\nhttps://t.co/1i47IPI00s GDP growth seems to be slower than it used to, why might this be? Well, if we agree that science is slowing down that's one culprit, but there are others some people have proposed: everything from regulation to demographic decline.\n\nhttps://t.co/MR0YLwCH2e Demographics: Now we have less young people and less population growth, that means fewer workers but also less people having ideas that could increase productivity. \n\nIn most models in economics that's the key driver of long term progress: People having ideas. Why is science slowing down? Why is growth slowing down in some sectors but not others?\n\nA progress studies approach would look at these problems, look at their history, what happened, look at current developments, look at incentives, &amp; propose solutions.\n\nhttps://t.co/FQ8WhwZaxt Unclear how much of it is natural (low hanging fruit) vs cultural vs regulatory vs us not having a major external threat (e.g. WWII or Cold War, for now) vs us not having a shared goal (e.g. Manifest Destiny)\n\nAlso unclear what comes first, the motivation or the innovation How to compare progress movement vs transhumanism?\n\nTranshumanism is a futuristic movement.\n\nThere's two main questions when it comes to progress:\n\u2022How can we go from 0 to 1 in some areas\n\u2022How can we distribute what already exists to more people\n\nhttps://t.co/Gpu9UFpm9K How do we instill an appreciation for progress?\n\nThe place to start is to tell the actual history. The history of progress has been lost. People take progress for granted, most people don't know, or they know in a weak sense how much life is better now than it was 100 yrs ago They just wake up in the morning on their foam mattress, and they roll out of bed to take a hot shower. And then they get fresh fruit out of the refrigerator and make fresh ground coffee, sit on the laptop and hop on the train to go into work in an air conditioned building... And they sit in their comfy chair, listening to their favorite music in their bluetooth headphones streaming through spotify....\n\n200 yrs ago, you'd have been hauling water from the well to take a bath, and the water might be contaminated and you might get cholera You'd walk to work or ride a horse, and your job was probably on a farm (16 hr days all year round in all weather), and you prob didn't have access to fresh fruit year round, and if you wanted music, you'd have to perform it yourself. \"These contrasts are not vivid for people....\n\nThe way we live today is a gift handed down by our ancestors, a gift that we should be grateful for. We should approach the world with more of that sense of gratitude and awe.\" ",

  "text": "There's a theory that asserts that the logical conclusion of social justice is cultural version of Marxism that ends up merging with its economic counterpart.\n\nhttps://t.co/1LFyeVe1qU\n\nThread unpacking this theory \ud83d\udc47 Zooming out:\n\nThe introduction of capitalism was a big deal.\n\nIt reoriented who became high status (e.g. merchants) &amp; who didn't (e.g. intellectuals)\n\nThose who lost status became resentful.\n\nSocialism catered to that resentment by promising status back to the low-status. Remember: What people care most about is status: https://t.co/iqyFLnlfQt\n\nChristianity promised the meek that they'd go to heaven unlike rich people.\n\nBut socialism was promising the goods here on Earth.\n\nWhich is why it became so popular. It's also highly effective, b/c it attracts ppl who are loyal.\n\nSay what you want about how horrific communism is (&amp; it is!), but it breeds loyalty. USSR was loyal. China is loyal.\n\nRich people aren't loyal. They have too many good options.\n\nYou're only as loyal as your options. Socialism didn't work in the west, b/c ppl got too rich.\n\nMore specifically, ppl believed in The American Dream, that they too could get rich if they worked hard &amp; had talent.\n\nFrom a Status calculus POV, it made more sense to believe in capitalism than socialism.\n\nBut today? This is why economic growth is so important.\n\nWhen we're not growing, the world becomes zero-sum. \n\nThere's a winner for every loser, &amp; ppl focus on capturing their piece of the pie instead of collectively expanding it.\n\nLow growth presents ripe conditions for Marxism.\n\nLike now? Remember, politics is similar to economics. It's about capturing as much power as possible\n\nIn economics, you do that by giving customers what they want\n\nIn politics, you do that by giving voters what you want\n\nWhat do lower status ppl want? Higher status\n\nhttps://t.co/hGCtVeTt4a Which is why Marxism is a highly effective strategy, especially when people aren't getting rich.\n\nElections are won by majorities. \n\nWhat politicians do is say to lower status people: vote for us, and we'll give you high status. \n\nDon't vote for us, and you'll remain low status. They don't even have to deliver on their promises.\n\nThey're inherently against the establishment, they can just keep blaming the establishment for the lack of change\n\nBeing unreasonable gets you more loyal followers than being reasonable, b/c reasonable people have more options. So what's Cultural Marxism?\n\nEconomic Marxism didn't work b/c social class isn't a strong enough identifier. Once you get rich, you stop being loyal. And ppl wanna be rich\n\nAlso, capitalism provided a counter vision\n\nSo overtime, ppl saw how rich the west was getting &amp; lost faith What's a better identifier? Well, identity. What you can't change: Gender, race, etc.\n\nThose are identifiers on which people will always be loyal.\n\nAnd so there's a huge opportunity to capture votes by appealing to those axes.\n\nEven when they get wealthy, they'll always be loyal. What they did was stick to the structure: promise high status to lower status people. \n\nBut they changed the content, adapted to the new era\n\nNow people weren't poor b/c class warfare, it was because of oppression\n\nIt spread wildly. Its foil is capitalism: https://t.co/xluhnAtug6 Communism lost partly b/c there was an attractive alternative in the west.\n\nAt some point Soviet communism became lower status than American capitalism.\n\nCultural Marxism has no such alternative to point to, so it's hard to switch.\n\nIt's is the highest status system in the world. Central to this theory is the belief that humans are wired to seek status\n\nAny good political agent will organize these ppl on the basis of increasing their status, the way any commercial agent will find a way to make money.\n\nEquality is an amazing path to power for a politician: If you\u2019re below average, \u201cequality\u201d sounds like \u201cboost in status\u201d, so inherently 1/2 population is always down\n\n&amp; the only way to enact this is to increase state power, which is why it's so politically appealing\n\nEasy way to get voters, &amp; easy way to justify expanding state power Cultural Marxism is less formalized than Economic Marxism was, partially because it can't be so explicit otherwise it'd be discredited.\n\nBut also because a distributed version (e.g. press, universities) is more effective. No central choke point. \n\nHow so?https://t.co/FeQhh7IhnS This is why they are so anti-capitalist.\n\nIt gives people more options to get status, namely making money.\n\nWhen you make money, you don't care as much (e.g. China)\n\nMaking money makes people less dependent on them and thus less loyal. If it\u2019s easy to earn status through money, you\u2019ll get a house (or start angel investing)\n\nIf there\u2019s no way you\u2019re making any money, you need another path. Which path?\n\nWell you can always virtue signal\n\nThis is why they attack The American Dream: it's a threat to their power How else has it become so powerful?\n\nWithout religion, we take moral cues from our political tribes: https://t.co/PFvHp3Hgbv\n\nSay what you want about socialism, but it is a collective morality\n\nFreedom isn't a morality, or at least a collective one\n\nThis is why libertarians lose Wait: How does Social Justice lead to Economic Marxism?\n\nZooming out: What's the end state where social justice would say, \"we accomplished our goal?\"\n\nAbsolute equality of outcome.\n\n(Logically, there is no equal opportunity without equality of outcome)\n\nhttps://t.co/MxZwxFBPyy They deny it of course b/c it (communism) is politically unfeasible\n\nTo be fair, they genuinely don't believe they are advocating for it.\n\nIn practice it's: \"I would never advocate for Marxism, I just advocate for all of the policies that would create and enforce Marxism.\" Meaning: when the goal is economic \"fairness\", there's no morally acceptable line until you get to total equality of outcome\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say \"OK, we have economic fariness now\"\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say: \"OK, the government is sufficiently powerful\"\n\nIt's always more. There's no in-between.\n\nYou're either a total egalitarian or you're not. If you are, you sign up for the whole package.\n\nIf you haven't yet, that's just temporary. \n\nThere's no stable middle ground.\n\nOtherwise your position is philosophically incoherent &amp; you will have no allies. Christopher Caldwell's book talks about how civil rights was explicitly sold on the basis of equality of opportunity for one specific group, but immediately morphed into equality of outcome for every group, &amp; created legal precedent to enact it.\n\nhttps://t.co/mobzRlEC3w Social justice aims to end all types of discrimination. \n\nInitially that was legal discrimination but over time the scope expanded.\n\nEquality (equal treatment) turned into equity (equal outcome).\n\nThat switch is how Cultural Marxism turns Economic. \n\nIt's a powerful wedge.

  "text": "How should VC firms think about follow-ons?\n\nVC is about getting paid for the risk you take. (h/t @m2jr)\n\nIf you're a seed fund you can get paid for the risk you take in two ways. \n\n1/ Investing in series A firms so you pay less money per % that you own.\n\n2/ Pro-rata. So seed firms say, I'm going to make a number of bets and then reserve for follow on to double down on winners.\n\nBut this is artificially limiting your pool.\n\nThe best series A firms don't just look at your companies, they look at every other good firm's companies too. More broadly, if you're going to put $1 into something, that dollar has to compete with every other investment opportunity you've got\n\nIf you put $1 at seed for every $2 in reserve for A, then what you're saying is you're basically a series A fund. And a disadvantaged one at that Most venture funds don't know what the return on the reserves are.\n\nBut it's often worse then their first check\n\nSo why do they put more into reserves than first check?\n\nSometimes b/c they truly have an advantage\n\nDeep down tho, b/c it fits their model of what it means to be a VC Often, price gets bid up faster than risk has gone down.\n\nOther times, best deals get bid up fastest.\n\n&amp; paradoxically, you may want to invest more b/c every incremental dollar will return a 10x\n\nUnituitive thing about power laws: the average increases the more exposure increases The case for follow on is that you have differentiated insight   into the co b/c of your proprietary access.\n\nYet, if so differentiated, why not pre-emptively lead the round, even if you led previous?\n\nThe most inefficiently priced deals may be the ones already in your portfolio. Often VCs have an ownership threshold, but maybe it's not as constructive to think about ownership as it is to think about what % of NAV is in a deal.\n\nIf you invest 400K &amp; own 10% &amp; company returns 30x you still only get $12M.\n\nWhat is my NAV &amp; what is my multiple opportunity? VCs are told 2 different things:\n\nInvest in contrarian bets other VCs won't invest in\n\nStay in your lane\u2014only lead pre-seed\n\nThis means, 18 months from investment, unless it's turned from contrarian -&gt; obvious, others won't invest\n\nPresents a challenge\u2014&amp;opportunity to double down Conclusion:\n\n- Don't follow on blindly b/c every follow on $ competes w/ every other company that could be invested in\n\n- VCs have to identify winners before they have them *and* when they have them\n\n- Double down if you see an inefficiency in the market within your own portfolio h/t @ashfontana &amp; @AliBHamed for conversations that led to latter half of this thread ",

  "text": "Some broader high-level thoughts on healthcare:\n\n- Comparing U.S. model to different models\n- Why employers pay for health insurance\n- Unique challenges facing U.S. healthcare\n- Recommendation for regulation change The challenge: \n\nEffectively we want unlimited access to healthcare services without having to pay for them.\n\nMedicare costs alone exceed any other country.\n\nSooner or later we will have to get this under control.\n\nOur options are either 1) ration costs or 2) have consumers pay. Trilemma: we want three things: \n\n1. we like to be insulated from the costs of health care, \n\n2. we like unlimited access to health care procedures, the best care now, and \n\n3. we ultimately have to worry what it costs. \n\nCan't have all three. Single payer option: idea is that government runs the health care system, it would be more streamlined, less paperwork, we could take all these costs out of the system. \n\nUnclear if it'd actually reduce costs. Regulations holding back innovation:\n\n- 5% of jobs at the end of WWII required a license and now it's something like 30%\n\n- Linking health insurance to employment. Locks ppl into jobs &amp; taxes employment\n\nWrote this on opportunities in digital health: https://t.co/hpjDUeg3N7 Why do employers pay for healthcare?\n\nRelic of WWII, where there was a wage freeze b/c of labor shortage.\n\nSo to attract labor, they started competing on benefits.\n\nFurther separates consumer from the cost of healthcare. Prevents some employees from leaving &amp; starting businesses. Small change that could be meaningful: \n\nMake any healthcare expense tax deductible or tax everything such that if consumers decide to go walk up to a hospital &amp; buy their own health care, then they can do that with the same tax equivalency as if they got it from their employers U.S healthcare quality is good, but bad at distributing &amp; financing it\n\nWHO ranking: If everybody gets A or B or C level care in country X, vs. another country where everybody gets C level care, country X w/ As, Bs, &amp; Cs gets worse ranking than the country that got everybody a C Different kinds of approaches:\n\nSingapore:\n\n- Only spend 4% of GDP on healthcare (In contrast to our 20%)\n\n- Only 30% gov't funded (in contrast to over 80% for us)\n\nHow? Combining best of private &amp; public.\n\nhttps://t.co/OQEwSoiC7T Different kinds of approaches to give everyone covered:\n\n- You can do government direct provision, the NHS model. \n\n- You can do single-payer, the Canadian model. \n\n- You can do regulation and cross subsidies, the Swiss or German models. \n\nThey can all work We pick &amp; choose different models.\n\nFor under 65, we're Germany\n\nFor over 65, we're national insurance.\n\nFor military, we're Britain\n\nFor millions uninsured, we're Cambodia.\n\nAll the other countries have settled on one model for everybody b/c of expedience. Not us. U.S. Healthcare is worst of all worlds:\n\nPrices aren\u2019t set by the market, but they also aren\u2019t set by the government. \n\nWe simultaneously miss out on the efficiency of a purely private system and on the savings of a purely public one. Some elements of healthcare have free markets and work well. \n\nSee: LASIK surgery.\n\nSince it's not covered by most insurance plans, ppl have to compare different services, their satisfaction records, and their prices. In short, they shop around. Good ones succeed &amp; bad ones die. In healthcare, consumers directly pay for less than 15%  of it.\n\nThe government (via taxes) &amp; health insurers pay for the rest.\n\nMany of these procedures are optional\n\nIf \"Blue Shield\" was \"Blue Eats\" &amp; you could eat as much as you want after $300, maybe ppl would eat a lot more. Myths of other models\n\n- It's all socialized\n- Ration care w/ waiting list &amp; limited choice\n- bloated bureaucracy \n- insurance companies have to be cruel\n- won't work in U.S.\n- it has to be all gov't or all private o work Effects of Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n\n- Improved consumer protections\n- Limited deductibles\n- Dropped uninsured rate from 18% to 10%\n- Established baseline for essential health benefits\n\nBut also:\n\n- Didn't effect cost or move to \"pay for value\"\n- Compromised on many core aspects Books I read &amp; recommend:\n\n- Chronic Care\n- The Healing of America\n- Myth or Magic: Singapore\n- Where Does it Hurt?

  "text": "Collection of scattered quotes &amp; ideas from Milton Friedman:\n\n\"The goal is to create a system where it is politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right things instead of politically profitable for the right people to do the wrong things\" K-12: \n\nYou can subsidize a producer or you can subsidize a consumer. \n\nIn education. we subsidize a producer (school) over the students.\n\nSchool vouchers would subsidize the students and create a real market where free schools would have incentive to serve everyone. What would happen if we had school choice? School diversity, just like restaurants.\n\nSome of them would concentrate on arts, others on sciences, others on vocational activities\n\nschools of every variety appealing to every taste to serve every need, the best ones rising to the top You'd think political coalitions would be bottom 51% vs. the top 49%, but that actually doesn't make much sense.\n\nThose at the bottom economically tend to be less skillful politically, so the coalition ends up being upper middle class and lower middle class vs the top and bottom What about 100% inheritance tax?\n\nThat encourages people to spend as much as possible, but what about future investment?\n\nThe amazing thing is is the extent to which the market system has encouraged people to work hard and sacrifice for their children. Social Security is also sold as a program to benefit the poor. \n\nBut Social Security is a program which imposes unduly heavy taxes on lower income groups in the society to provide higher benefit to upper income groups in the society, because they live longer and get to enjoy it. Great Depression was a failure of gov\u2019t via monetary policy, not private business.\n\nDuring 1929-1933, total quality of money declined by 1/3.\n\nWhy are gov\u2019t so popular even when it doesn\u2019t work?\n\nMarket has no press agents. Gov't has great many press agents. The goal is to create a system where it is politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right things instead of politically profitable for the right people to do the wrong things Before 1914 mass immigration was easier \u2014 became difficult once we implemented the welfare state, can't afford it infinitely. despite all the rhetoric about the minimum wage helping the poor, the unions were in favor of a higher minimum wage for a very different reason, because it would protect the members of their unions from competition from the lower and lesser skilled people. In the first place, all of these programs involve some people spending other people's money for objectives that are determined by still a third group of people.\n\nNobody spend somebody else's money as carefully as the person who spends their own. Someone once said, there are no problems in NYC that couldn't be solved if the city budget was twice what it is now.\n\nCity budget has tripled and many projects are worse. When gov't has more money, citizens have less to spend. Citizens spend $ more carefully than gov'ts do on avg \"Why is housing so bad in NYC? Bad governmental policy.\n\nIf you have eliminated the government from the housing market, and left that money in the hands of the people themselves, the housing situation in the US today would be far better than it is.\" We are expected to conclude that the rich are responsible for the deprivation of the poor.\n\nThey are rich at the expense of the poor.\n\nBut the truth is that\u2019s not what happens .\n\nThere has never been a more effective machine for eliminating poverty than free markets. Life is unfair. \n\nThere's nothing fair about one men being born blind and another man being born with sight. \n\nThere's nothing fair about one man being born of a wealthy parent and one of a poor parent.\n\nThere's nothing fair about Lebron being able to dunk and you can't. Classic MF: \"I am a liberal, I believe in freedom liberalism means of and belonging to freedom pertaining to freedom. Those people who now call themselves liberals have misappropriated the term because for them it simply means that they are liberal with other people's money.\" We talk about market failures, but those happen occasionally. Whereas the same market failures (i.e negative externalities &amp; principle-agent problems) are built into most gov't actions \n\nWhich makes the cure often worse than the disease. Government protects its workers, just as trade unions protect their members, but both do it at someone else's expense.\n\nWhen unions get higher wages for their members by restricting entry into an occupation, those higher wages are at the expense of other workers. When government pays its employees higher wages, those higher wages are at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nBut when when employees get higher wages through the competition of the free market, those higher wages are at nobody's expense, and are often at other's benefit. Bigger pie. Invisible hand in economics: People intend to serve private interest but actually also serve public interests.\n\nInvisible hand in politics: People intend to serve public interests but actually end up serving private interests. \"Mr Friedman what policies would lead to adequate housing for all the poor?\n\n\"Well, What we now consider inadequate, would have been considered a palace 150 years ago. Avg income of the poor is higher than avg income of all the people in USSR.\" So you have to ask a very different kind of question:\n\nWhat system will give the widest range of people the greatest opportunity to make the most out of themselves?  In that system you'll have higher standards of housing for all. \"The society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither. \n\nThe society that puts freedom before equality will end up w/ a great measure of both\"\n\n\"There's no justification whatsoever for cutting down all the tall trees in order that there be no tree in the forest\" Of all the revolutions that have taken place in the world the American Revolution is unique in having given birth to a free society.\n\nNeither the Russian, French, or Chinese revolutions did.

All super aggregators benefit from strong network effects, both on the supply and demand side; these network effects, supercharged by the ability to scale for free, are these companies\u2019 moats. Newspapers used to enjoy local monopolies on distribution.\n\nGoogle &amp; FB didn't create better newspapers, they reduced newspapers to any other type of content, and made it compete with all other content in the world.\n\nhttps://t.co/kkp1bUYnHt Publishers took advertising for granted (or, as journalists put it, erected a \u201cseparation of church &amp; state\u201d) under the assumption they had a monopoly on reader attention\n\nAdvertisers don\u2019t care about readers; they care about identifying, reaching &amp; converting potential customers Publishers going forward need to have the exact opposite attitude from past publishers: instead of focusing on journalism first and biz model 2nd, publishers need to start w/ a sustainable biz model &amp; focus on journalism that works hand-in-hand with the biz model they've chosen. Publishers need to answer the most important Q required of any enterprise: are they a niche or scale business?\n\nNiche businesses make money by maximizing revenue per user on a (relatively) small user base.\n\nScale businesses make money by maximizing the number of users they reach. The truth is most publications are trying to do a little bit of everything: gain more revenue per user here, reach more users over there. However, unless you\u2019re the NYT, trying to do everything is a recipe for failing at everything\n\nThese strategies require diff approaches On one side you will have the aggregators as ideal vehicles for content creators who value reach; on the other new kinds of tools that enable direct connection\u2014&amp; funding\u2014from fans. Maybe this whole Internet thing will turn out pretty good after all\u2026unless you\u2019re a publisher. Video is safer b/c it's very expensive to produce (or buy rights to), so hard to substitute \n\nVideo has been increasingly differentiating itself on either quality (HBO) or exclusivity (ESPN)\n\nThe value of tech cos in each space is inversely proportional to value of the publishers The rule of thumb around marketplace businesses is that you either have a low take rate and high margins or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge w/ Neither/New companies (e.g WeWork) end up with relatively low take rates combined w/ relatively mediocre margins.\n\nhttps://t.co/hANITRohrX And that's what's wrong w/ Microsoft. It\u2019s not they don\u2019t have talent\u2014they do. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have great tech\u2014they do.\n\nRather, it\u2019s that they achieved their goal. There IS a computer on every desk &amp; in very home, &amp; nearly all of them run Microsoft software. \n\nNow what? Microsoft: \n\nI am skeptical that Microsoft\u2019s antitrust issues were a major factor in Microsoft missing mobile; the company had the wrong approach, both in terms of product and business model. Twitter:\n\nSince finding PM-fit came so easily, Twitter still has no idea what their market actually is, and how they might expand it.\n\nTwitter is the company-equivalent of a lottery winner who never actually learns how to make money, and now they are starting to pay the price. Twitter had huge potential:\n\nWhereas Google is valuable because it knows what I want, when I want to get it, Facebook knows who I am, and who I know. \n\nTwitter, on the other hand, knows exactly what I like and what I\u2019m interested in. Twitter had problems scaling growth b/c of their onboarding experience, so they focused on maximizing monetization per user:\n\nIt's a challenge to get ppl to re-try a product they have already dismissed. \n\nIn the meantime, they have to monetize the users they have Economics of software: massive fixed cost, effectively zero marginal costs.\n\nIt was expensive to develop Windows, but Microsoft could reuse the software on all computers; every new computer sold was pure profit. It was expensive to build Google, but search can be extended to anyone with an Internet connection; every new user was an opportunity to show more ads.\n\nIt was expensive to build Facebook, but the network can scale to two billion people and counting, all of which can be shown ads They let others handle less profitable marginal components, at least initially\n\nGoogle builds the search engine and leaves the creation of web pages to be searched to the rest of the world\n\nFB builds the infrastructure of the network, &amp; leaves the content creation to its users Politicians designed for the TV age \u2014 i.e meant to be palatable to the greatest # of ppl \u2014 are at a disadvantage on platforms like FB. \n\nThe Politicians that win inspire passion, stirring up a level of engagement that breaks through on a scale that far exceeds an ad buy. \"It\u2019s a really cool ad about ppl creating that kinda forgot to say how Dropbox makes that all possible, kinda like how Dropbox built a really great product that solved a real problem but kinda forgot\u2014or more generously, waited far 2 long\u2014to build a huge sustainable biz around it\" Apple is all about focus, Amazon is The Everything Store.\n\nApple has high margins, Amazon says \"your margins are my opportunity.\" \n\nApple is a product co that struggles w services, Amazon is a service co that struggles w product.\n\nMultiple ways to be successful. /FIN\n\nBarely scratching the surface here. There's TONS of stuff I'm not including.\n\nGo spend some hours (or years) reading his work, from front-to-back.

  "text": "People usually defend free speech by making the legal or moral case for it, but I want to make the utilitarian case for free speech (and \"the marketplace of ideas\" more broadly)\u2014and describe how these concepts have helped enable the moral progress we celebrate today.\n\nThread \ud83d\udc47 People want to limit free speech in the name of \u201cholding ppl accountable\u201d for unacceptable speech.\n\nThey don\u2019t want hurtful views to perpetuate, especially if they've caused harm in the past.\n\nThis may be well intentioned, but I worry it misunderstands how moral progress happens. If you think about the moral progress we made in the last 100 years, there was a time when that exact progress was deemed \"harmful\"\u2014when it was a view people would get \"canceled\" for, in the name of \u201cholding them accountable\u201d\n\nThose \"harmful\" ideas entered the marketplace &amp; won If you prevent ideas from entering the marketplace, you'll miss out on moral progress\n\nWe must assume that anything in charge of \u201cholding people accountable\u201d is likely wrong about something (otherwise there'd be no more moral progress) &amp; should be appropriately humble as a result Of course, most unpopular ideas are not breakthroughs, they're dumb.\n\nBut 1 in 100 or a million make up for all the dumb ideas. \n\nThe idea for example, that monarchy is not the proper form of government was deeply offensive at the time. So was evolution, the world is round, etc An open conversation allows millions of minds to go to work on these offensive ideas &amp; find the few gold nuggets, the needles in the haystack and throw the rest away.\n\nBut even for the dumb ideas\u2014the best way to eliminate them is to bring them to light so they can be fought. B/c suppression doesn\u2019t change minds\n\nYou may suppress for a while, but you won\u2019t change minds (they may double down actually), &amp; once they have power, they may silence you.\n\nYou should only create a system that you\u2019d be OK w/ in the hands of your enemy, because 1 day it will be. When you curtail free speech, what happens is that you weaken the quest for knowledge and moral improvement, and knowledge and moral improvement is ultimately the solution to eliminating hate\n\nHate comes out of fear and out of ignorance. And you fight that with knowledge. There is a long history behind censoring &amp; punishing ppl for what they say &amp; it's not good: Think China, Russia, Germany at their worst moments\n\nInstead of saying that curtailing free speech doesn't cause much harm, make the case for how censorship has led to \nmore moral progress Free speech doesn't mean \"freedom of consequences\"\n\nBut we should not let their \"consequences\" also prevent moral progress\n\nIf we want moral progress, we must respond to arguments w/ counter arguments, not bullets (economic), b/c those same bullets can be used at us &amp; our speech Let's give one example of the marketplace of ideas in action: Gay rights\n\nRemember, most people in America once believed homosexuality was a mental illness, &amp; that pro-gay speech was bigoted. They wanted to prevent these ideas from entering the marketplace.\"Hold them accountable\" Jonathan Rauch believes the US has done a better job w/ gay rights than Europe because in the US we could\nidentify the hate, confront the fears underlying it, and contrasting the truth against it&amp;discredit hate in ppl minds\u2014That's what we did.\n\n\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant\u201d Consider this story to illustrate the point:\n\nIn 1957 a man named Frank Kameny is fired from his government job as an astronomer, and he's fired because he's gay. No other reason, but because he's gay.\n\nSo remember gay people in this time were treated very poorly: They were arrested in their own homes for making love to each other (&amp; got criminal records), they'd get openly beaten on the streets, and if they called the police, the police would often join in the fun, arrest the gay person instead of the person who committed the crime. Back to Frank Kameny. He never served as an astronomer again. That was expected\n\nBut what was unexpected was that he did not back down.\n\nHe believed that the Declaration of Independence was a personal promise that the founders had made to him and he decided to ensure his promise So he began an opposition movement. He appealed his firing to the US government. He failed. He appealed it to the Supreme Court. He failed. He appealed to Congress. He failed &amp; received letters saying \u201cof all the letters I've ever received, yours is the most disgusting\u201d Frank says, I went to Europe to fight tyranny overseas, only to come home and discover that I must now fight the tyranny in the US.\n\nSo he then begins representing other gay people who've been fired from their jobs because he's determined. He will win in the marketplace of ideas. In 1965 Frank and some other people led the first peaceful, openly gay protest with a protest march in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nin 1970, Frank's the first openly gay person to run for Congress. He loses, but he keeps pushing for the cause. He knows he's right. He challenges the psychiatric diagnosis of homosexuality as a disease. He does all this stuff for years, and no one ever listens\n\nUntil they do start listening! In the 70s, people begin to notice what he &amp; other gay activists are saying\n\nHis ideas start winning in the marketplace As society held its prejudice to critical scrutiny, over enough time the prejudice lost its appeal. It just didn't make sense. As soon as it did, the dominoes of hate started to fall, and within a generation people can't believe we ever had a problem w/ gay marriage. So Frank Kameny died in 2011 at age 86. \n\nHe lived long enough not only to see same sex marriage be legal in multiple states, and to see sodomy laws overturn, and to see gay people serving in US government in secure positions and to see gay people serve in the military\u2014\n\nIn 2009\u2014 He lived long enough to receive a formal apology from the US gov't from the very agency that fired him\n\nHe received their Roosevelt prize for public service\u2014their highest prize\n\nAnd best of all, the director of the agency that had fired him that was now apologizing was openly gay So this is the power of free speech and the marketplace of ideas.\n\nFrank didn't have money. He didn't have anything but the power of his ideas &amp; a marketplace to compete in. \n\nAnd that is the thing we must protect if we want to sustainably change minds and enable moral progress. /FIN\n\nFor those who want to go deeper, I recommend reading:  @jon_rauch's book \"Kindly Inquisitors\".

  "text": "Collection of scattered quotes &amp; ideas from Thomas Sowell. \n\n\"If the government took over the Sahara Desert, there would be a shortage of sand.\" There was a time where only 10% of American homes had flush toilets and only 3% had electric lights.\n\nWhat changed? Markets.\n\nLook at any society that achieved economic growth \u2014 no one ever credits any specific leader. It's often markets (Except Lee Kuan Yew, who enabled markets) What about gov't? \n\nStudy what happens when the gov't does something compared to what happens when they do nothing?\n\nFor first 150 years of this country, gov't did nothing when there was a downturn.\n\nin 1921, unemployment rate was 12%. Harding did nothing, it went back to 3%. People talk about the kind of the government has to intervene because we had, you know, 25% unemployment during the Great Depression. \n\nAnd what they don't understand is, there was only 25% unemployment after the government intervened. Ppl in different income brackets are discussed as though they are different ppl, as opposed to to ppl at different stages of their lives\n\n56% of U.S. households will be in the top 10% at some point in their lives\n\nOf all the ppl in the top 1%, only 13% are in the top 1% for 2 yrs And the number who are in the bottom 20%, only 5% of them remain the next year. 29% of them will have gotten to the top, over 50% in the top half.\n\nAnd so you're comparing what happens to these abstract categories rather than what's happening to actual flesh and blood people? Bottom 20% of ppl are mostly: young ppl, old ppl, &amp; immigrants. The fact that young ppl &amp; new immigrants have low income is no surprise...they're just getting into the game. And the fact that old ppl have low incomes also isn't surprising...they aren\u2019t in the labor force anymore! What you\u2019d really want to see is a cohort chart where you see what happens to people who start in each bucket over time \n\nWhen people say \u201cthe incomes of most American households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades\u201d they are painting a strawman. There is no such thing as a \u201chousehold\u201d. They vary over time. They vary from one group &amp; income level to another. \n\ne.g. there are 39M ppl in the bottom 20% of households, and 64M in the top 20%. So you're saying yes, 24 million additional people do tend to have more money. Over a period of about 30 years, the household income rose by only 6%. over those same years, per capita income rose by 51%. Because the number of people per household was declining all the while. There are a lot of people who regard so called disparities and inequities and income is something that requires some great explanation seem to assume that in the absence of some intervention, everyone would have something roughly equal income. Constrained vision=Human nature is flawed, but fixed, so how do we erect institutions that contain our flaws?\n\nPpl's outcomes are often constrained by reality\n\nUnconstrained vision=Human nature is malleable\n\nThe unconstrained vision looks at pain &amp; says we must remove the pain There is no one who from sheer intellectual power can tell you what the law ought to be\n\nThe Q is, who shall have the authority to change that law &amp; with what constraints on that person so that that person is not just giving event to their own feelings or imaginings or theories? In order to win politically, ppl have to depict the problems in ways that will allow them to play the role of rescuers\n\nAnd so there\u2019s no talk about resilience or self-reliance. \n\nYou have to tell them their problems were caused by somebody else, otherwise why do they need you? Why it's bad to hate builders:\n\nB/c you attack the people who are creating the most wealth, not only for themselves, but society. \n\nPpl don't get wealth exploiting. They get wealth b/c others pay them b/c they are getting value in return. Ppl like to put down billionaires &amp; say they are exploiting the poor\n\nBut if you compare the data there are more billionaires in the U.S. than in Africa &amp; the Middle East put together &amp; yet the standard of living for the poor in the U.S. is higher than that of ppl in Africa + ME On how Socialism stinks:\n\nRussia had all the natural resources you could imagine\n\nIt was the only industrial nation which has so much petroleum that they export oil\n\nAnd the irony is one of the world's great famines occurred in the USSR. How come? mismanagement by the gov't Taxes:\n\nPeople get upset at billionaires for paying less in taxes as a % than their secretaries, but...fake news.\n\nFirst of all, the vast majority of taxes are paid by people in the upper 10% of the country\n\nIt may well be that if someone has capital gains, they'll pay lower rate Effect of tax cuts on the economy was to increase the rate of growth, increase the revenue received by the government. \n\nThe rich not only paid more taxes after the tax cuts for the rich, as they call it, they paid a higher percentage of all taxes. In the early 20s, the tax rate on the top income was 70%. The ppl making over $100,000 paid something like 30% of all taxes. \n\nBy the end of the decade, the tax rate on the top had been cut to 24% so ppl making over 100,000 now paid 65% of all taxes &amp; the reason is quite simple: That when you have a tax rate of 73% people simply don't pay it (i.e. find loopholes)\n\nSo it's the choice between a symbolic high tax rate on wealthy ppl to win votes\u2014Which the rich themselves are not gonna pay\u2014Or actual more tax revenue coming in to the gov't. Trickle down theory not a theory, it's a caricature\n\nPpl think if you cut tax rates on the rich, then there'll be less taxes for the government, or you'll have to raise the taxes on other people to make up the difference or cut programs and so forth. The above disproves that. Why are ppl poor?\n\nPpl are born poor. The Q is less why are ppl poor and more why are some ppl rich\n\nAsking this gives us an appreciation for what got us rich, (markets), and how we can get more ppl rich, rather than implying that the rich have gotten rich at expense of the poor. Higher Ed\n\nWhy has cost been rising?\n\nGov't. If tuition is over a certain amount, you get more gov't funding. Thus it incentivizes unis to charge more\n\nOne reason professors cost more is that their opportunity cost is higher bc they could get paid more to go into other industries This review gives more details: https://t.co/OvBrKNQIjL\n\nThe above tweets are just a tiny fraction of his ideas written over 30 books...

You sum up what people think &amp; converge on truth.\n\nIf they are succumbing to groupthink, peer pressure or preference falsification, then it's Madness. Enlightenment vs Christian view: Wisdom of crowds vs Madness of crowds\n\nWisdom is only when ppl are making decisions as individuals. You sum up what ppl think &amp; converge on truth.\n\nIf they are succumbing to groupthink, peer pressure or preference falsification, then it's Madness. Innovation tends to happen in highly networked ecosystems (h/t \"Where Good Ideas Come From\")\n\nBut there\u2019s a point where the network effects\u2014the fact that everyone\u2019s connected &amp; knows what everyone\u2019s thinking\u2014leads to everyone thinking the same thing &amp; shifts to madness of crowds. The madness starts innocuously, at, say, prestigious MBA programs.\n\nWhen you take ppl who are extremely socialized &amp; talented but who have relatively few convictions of their own, &amp; have them talk to each other trying to figure out what to do, they end up converging on safe paths Those paths aren't as safe as we think\n\n1990 they all wanted to work for Michael Milken one or two years before he went to jail. \n\nThey only pursued SV in 1999 and timed the bubble perfectly. \n\nA lot of innovation depends on being immune from socialization.https://t.co/BEOObmKo8N This goes beyond MBA programs. \n\nHenry Kissinger described the broader academic version of this: \"the battles in academia are so ferocious because the stakes are so small.\"\n\nWhen the differences are smaller, the stakes are higher for the same turf. Being highly networked and transparent has clear benefits, but also has costs.\n\nOne is that you're less likely to try anything contrarian if you feel you're always being watched.\n\nAlso if you're always being watched, someone will always find fault with you\nhttps://t.co/qVRisTTaen We're less likely to take risks. \n\nSo we do things that look good to others, which means that others are doing them too, which means it's probably  hyper competitive, which means it's probably not a great idea. Competition makes us better at that which we're competing on, but it narrows our focus to beating the people around us. \n\nIt distracts us from things that are more valuable or more important or more meaningful It's amazing how these psychosocial forces homogenize people\u2019s thinking\n\nIt's not new\n\n90s - internet bubble\n2000s - housing &amp; finance\n2010 - gov't bubble\n\nAll characterized by a lack of critical thinking &amp; assuming that other people had figured things out &amp; deferring to them. Wisdom of Crowds vs Madness of Crowds:\n\nif you're 51/49 majority, that's probably more right than wrong: Wisdom.\n\nIf it's a 70/30 majority, well, that's even better. It's even wiser\n\nBut if you have a 99/100 to zero majority, you're North Korea: Madness. People tend to want to defer to the crowd, but at the end of the day, that\u2019s probably not how the system really changes. \n\nIt probably will be changed by some idiosyncratic people who have really strong convictions, and are over time, able to convince more people of them. In a hyperconnected world, it's harder to be eccentric (as a scientist, thinker, anything) b/c there's nowhere to hide.\n\nWe're all mad. Nietzsche said that madness is rare in individuals but in nations &amp; crowds of people, it\u2019s the rule. That was before Nietzsche himself went mad. For people to challenge convention they sometimes have to imitate what people with Asperger's do naturally: Be vaguely oblivious to it all and push forward.\n\nOr be hyper aware of consensus, and think from first principles so you can assess when it makes sense &amp; when it doesn't. \"We need to ask, what is it about our society where those of us who do not suffer from Asperger\u2019s are at some massive disadvantage because we will be talked out of our interesting, original, creative ideas before they are even fully formed?\" - Peter Thiel The challenge of crowds is that one submits to it.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of a very large crowd that\u2019s trying to do something, there\u2019s always this question, what\u2019s even the point b/c it\u2019ll happen anyway, you won\u2019t make that much of a difference relative to what you could otherwise do. It's dangerous to live in a world where people are super uncomfortable saying what they think.\n\nWe want to have debates on a lot of areas, and ask the hard Q's in science &amp; technology &amp; philosophy &amp; religion,  &amp; unearth the controversial but true ideas\n\nhttps://t.co/Ei6WhxUE5T Hyper-connectivity exacerbates the concerns ppl have around political correctness\n\nThe less privacy people have, the more pressure exists\n\nHow soon is it before we start monitoring minds for socially acceptable things to think? If the technology were there, we'd be doing it today Originality is hard. It goes against our instincts:\n\nAlready in the time of Shakespeare, the word \u2018ape\u2019 meant both primate and to imitate. \n\nThere is this imitation aspect to human nature that runs very deep. It\u2019s how we learn language as kids, it\u2019s how culture gets transmitted. But it also leads to many forms of insane behavior: peer pressure, market bubbles, cult religions, etc.\n\nIt starts by being able to tune out the people around you, being passionate about some idea or something more transcendent\u2014and, of course, being right. How does wisdom turn into madness?\n\nGirardian explanation: We want what other ppl want, leads into envy, that leads to violence.\n\nChristianity response: Don\u2019t look up to other people you compete with, look up to Jesus. Don't scapegoat &amp; purge others. Look within &amp; purge your sins John Stuart Mill warned about the perverse effects of conformity centuries ago: \n\nHe also offered the moral argument behind his proposeed cure: pursuing individuality to strengthen collective knowledge.\n\nhttps://t.co/OLbMmCANT9 ",

  "text": "Summary / takeaways from the book \"The Age of Entitlement\" by Christopher Caldwell.\n\nThe main thesis is that we have two irreconcilable constitutions, and our country is split over which constitution they subscribe to, the one of 1789 or 1964\n\nhttps://t.co/sm2IKrLTHH Passing civil rights act of 1964 (which he supports &amp; which worked!) created legal precedents that expanded beyond its initial scope\n\nMeant to stop segregation in the south, it later set precedents into uplifting other groups beyond race (e.g. immigrants, children, gay rights) Even just within race, it was never meant to expand beyond segregation in the south.\n\nHubert Humphrey said, \u201cIf this results in affirmative action, I\u2019ll eat the bill\u201d \n\nIn the Congressional debate then, you can see ppl mocking others worried about things that later came to pass Given that segregation was such a severe issue, + the rampant racism at the time, it made sense to challenge the prevailing understanding of the 1st Amendment as protecting not just freedom of assembly, but freedom of association.\n\nFor that issue.\n\nBut wasn't so clear for others. The distinction some ppl draw is between individual rights and group rights.\n\nPeople were always \"protected\" as individuals, but today they're protected as groups.\n\nUnclear how to determine which groups need extra gov't protection beyond individual rights &amp; in what capacities. \"Civil Rights Act became the mechanism through which to spread an entire social agenda that the American people did not necessarily vote for, agree to, or even particularly want in the moment..\n\nserved as a precedent for kind of activist government in the in the years that follow What's big wasn't just the outcomes, it was the legal precedent set by the *process*\n\nIn short, power moved from congress to courts.\n\nBy moving to the courts, activists could get written into law things that were highly unpopular &amp; would never get legislated otherwise.\n\nShortcut. Bilingual education, for example, was implemented tops-down by the courts without any vote or pre-existing law.\n\nThis could have only happened based on legal precedent Civil Rights set.\n\nBypassing congress became an alternative way of conducting politics in the United States By the late 70s, you had something going on where you had a very expensive new constitution, but a public that was not willing to pay for it, &amp; wanted to go back to 1789 constitution.\n\nRaegan ran on this platform &amp; won. But he didnt/couldnt overturn it\n\nInstead he called a truce. Reagan ended up satisfying both constitutions by paying for it via debt.\n\nCombination of Raegan tax cuts plus social programs plus competing with Russia put us in debt. \n\nHe tried to have his cake &amp; eat it too, which worked temporarily, but future generations had to pay for it. \"So overwhelming is the hegemony of this 1964 constitution over the 1788 constitution, that our politics has pretty naturally sorted itself.\n\ninto a party of those who have been helped by the new constitutional developments and the party of those who have been harmed by it.\" In light of all this, it's interesting to think about intersectionality &amp; identity politics as not just cultural or intellectual fashions/belief systems, but also, among other things, legal strategies adaptive to their environments, thanks to 1964. The book then goes on to chronicle how Clinton accelerated it, how not much happened under Bush here, how Obama accelerated it\u2014and the book conveniently ends right before Trump is elected.\n\n/FIN. \n\nInterested in hearing responses to Caldwell's ideas ",

But if prices are high b/c demand went up, then consumers will buy more.\n\nSame w/ interest rates: they can change for many reasons.\n\nOne might be easy money.\n\nAnother might be b/c of changes in underlying economy, often due to a previous tight money decision which slowed economy Another example of reasoning from a price change:\n\nWages are higher during prosperous periods.\n\nJust like wealthy people tend to drive nicer cars.\n\nBut driving a Porsche doesn't make you wealthy, and artificially raising wage levels doesn't make it a prosperous period.

The great problem in society is how you deal with conflict.\n\nWe use markets to determine who has economic resources.\n\nWe use democracy to determine who has political power.\n\nAnd we use science to determine who has truth. \"A market game is an open-ended, decentralized process for allocating resources &amp; legitimizing possession.\n\nA democracy game is an open-ended, decentralized process for legitimizing the use of force.\n\nA science game is an open-ended, decentralized process for legitimizing belief\" \"In biological evolution, no species is spared the rigors of competition\u2014nor are the participants in capitalism, democracy, science. \n\nNo matter who you are, you must conduct your business in the currency of dollars, votes, or criticism\u2014no special fiat, no personal authority.\" \"Much as creatures compete for food, so entrepreneurs compete for business, candidates for votes, &amp; hypotheses for supporters.\n\nAs in biological evolution, no outcome is fixed or final\u2014nor is it in liberalism.\n\nThere is always another trade, another election, another hypothesis.\" Objections to liberalism:\n\nThe Fundamentalist Principle: Those who know the truth should decide who's right.\n\nThe Egalitarian Principle: All persons\u2019 beliefs have equal claims to respect.\n\nThe Humanitarian Principle: The first priority is \"cause no harm.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/MizngVPJXr Fundamentalists say that science is wrong.\n\nEgalitarians say that we are prioritizing science over other ways of knowing.\n\nHumanitarians say that certain speech is hurtful.\n\nLiberals say that subjecting ideas to public criticism is the only legitimate way to decide who is right Fundamentalism is totalitarian (Do what I want b/c I say so).\n\nEpistemological egalitarianism justifies arguments like \"creationism=evolution\"\n\nHumanitarianism sacrifice society for an individual (e.g gay marriage took forever b/c ppl were offended by it)\n\nhttps://t.co/Y7u3bg0H16 \"Under liberalism, you can do anything you wish to test a statement, as long as you follow the rules:\n\n1- The system may not fix the outcome in advance or for good (no final say). \n\n2- The system may not distinguish between participants (no personal authority).\" Those who worry about the death of liberalism worry that\nthe old principle of the Inquisition is being revived: ppl who hold harmful opinions should be punished for the good of society\n\nThey worry that if speech is considered violence, so will science/math\nhttps://t.co/T8P0uKBFWK They also worry about epistemological relativism\n\nLiberal science insists on freedom of belief&amp;speech, but not freedom of knowledge\n\nE.g Christian Scientists who unsuccessfully treat their sick children with prayer are charged w/ manslaughter, while parents who try surgery aren't Liberal science is egalitarian.\n\nIt's true that some ppl have been systematically denied access, but that represents not the failure of liberalism but the failure to embrace it.\n\nShunning science for being used incorrectly is like shunning democracy b/c certain ppl couldn\u2019t vote. The reason liberal science is important is not because we're all liberal, tolerant people at heart\u2014most of us aren't.\n\nIn fact, we're all mostly fundamentalists at heart. We think we're right.\n\nLiberalism protect us from our totalitarian instincts \u2014to demand people agree with us. Much of this summarized from (or quoting directly) Jonathan Rauch's \"Kindly Inquisitors\" https://t.co/N7HduzBEJo\n\nRelated thread on free speech: https://t.co/Ei6WhxUE5T ",

After years of asymmetric negativity &amp; harassment under the auspice of \u201cjournalism\u201d (I dox, you leak, a journalist investigates), getting CEOs fired, finally tide is changing.\n\nhttps://t.co/GvBYSxK3Fs In the eyes of journalists, this was yet another tech bro being a bully and subverting the free press, and more so the continuation of a dangerous trend that started w/ Peter Thiel at Gawker.\n\nhttps://t.co/T0TyvWHFEk It\u2019s interesting how divergent perceptions are:\n\nTechnologists see themselves as the building the technologies saving the world\u2014After all, it\u2019s time to build!\n\nJournalists see themselves as watchdogs holding tech companies accountable for negative externalities of their creations Journalists see technologists as far more powerful: millionaires who can control &amp; manipulate customer behavior at their will without impunity. \n\nIn their view this is just them trying to avoid accountability for their creations and scape goat them. \n\nhttps://t.co/FsNtJZ8Loc Technologists see journalists as more powerful in that they are effectively police issuing social sanctions without accountability (who watches the watchers?) \n\nAnd very influential with all seeing gov't, whom they don\u2019t investigate (gov't, not president)\n\nhttps://t.co/3mQSXUvcTo Paraphrasing glibly: China has a state-controlled press, but the U.S. has a press-controlled state, in the sense that politicians pander to voters, &amp; voters are swayed by the press, logic goes.\n\nPost social media, that monopoly has eroded, paving the way for citizen journalists. Some people pit the barriers as old money vs new money, but it may be old status vs new status: \n\nWho should society revere more?\n\nThose who speak truth to power or those who use their powers to discover truth &amp; make new things?\n\nWhat do I think? Both but:\nhttps://t.co/SCG7yMsF7K We should move on.\n\nIt's too easy to criticize without building, and we should protect against those natural instincts\u2014to blame, to envy, to scapegoat, &amp; do nothing but make it harder for the ppl who are making progress to do so\n\nhttps://t.co/jDyfE4wJ8a\n\nhttps://t.co/y7Zk04Tbwo ",
