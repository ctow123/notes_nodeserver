Let us not allow divisions to tear us apart\u2026Let us be friends; not colleagues.\" For Obama, peace meant the end of the war, and the end of the cycle of hate.\n\nAfter taking office, Trump promised to end the war, end the torture, and bring home American prisoners. But that same day, as he was flying back to Palm Beach, Florida, his plane was hit by an apparent drone. Trump took the blame, and said, on camera, \"After this, you can ask for forgiveness.\"\n\nOne day, however, the Trump administration actually acknowledged that drones were dangerous, and tried to end their use.
