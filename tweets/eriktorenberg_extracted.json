There's always an incubation period.Blockchain is a new kind of meta computer that has this property of being able to make certain trust guarantees to users and to developers and to other people that you can't make w/ a traditional computer.\n\nCode becomes law, and you go from \"Don't Be Evil\" to \"Can't Be Evil\"Ideas need to be contrarian, otherwise big companies will just do them, or other competitors will emerge.\n\nSo we need to find good ideas that look like bad ideas but aren't actually bad ideas, even though most seemingly bad ideas are, in fact, bad ideas.How ppl respond to new tech\n\nI never heard of it\nI heard of it, but don\u2019t get it\nI get it, &amp; see how rich ppl would like it, but it's not useful for me\nI use it, but it\u2019s just a toy\nI use it all the time\nI can't imagine life without it\nIt\u2019s too powerful and needs to be regulated2 Critiques of Silicon Valley:\n\n1/ Not working on big enough problems. It's all silly apps. Should be more ambitious &amp; actually change the world. \n\n2/ SV is having too big an impact on culture &amp; society. It must be regulated.\n\nNobody attempts to reconcile these two critiques.With new technologies is very easy to imagine the jobs that will go away--it's very hard to imagine the new jobs created, b/c by definition, they don't exist yet.\n\n20 yrs ago, how could you have imagined jobs like \"Uber Driver\", \"Social Media Manager\", \"Mobile App Designer\"?Q regarding Carlotta Perez cycle\n\nhttps://t.co/IMgIkThRXo\n\nThe Q is whether the cycle she describes applies to software the same way it applies to hardware.W/ hardware, you're fundamentally limited by the laws of physics whereas software, the degrees of freedom are literally the limits of human thought.\n\nThere's only so many ways to put together a semiconductor; there's an infinite ways to put together a set of cryptocurrencies.The details are important b/c the implications are significant:\n\nIf software is like hardware, the solution to centralization is likely some form of regulation.\n\nIf software is something different, potentially technological and market forces that can correct the centralization3 billion people have smartphones. It's a miracle. \n\nBy the way, if you go back &amp; read science fiction, no one predicted the internet. They predicted like flying cars &amp; robots, but no one predicted you'd have like a supercomputer in your pocket with access to all the information",

    "full_text": "Why did wages start decoupling from productivity in 1973 in the US?\n\nSummary of this Slate Star Codex post: https://t.co/D5pEJPcTZu https://t.co/HJUBujbaBzMaybe the fact that health insurance has skyrocketed has obfuscated what's happening: That total compensation has increased much more than wages have.  \n\nPartly. But the lowest-paid workers don't have health insurance. And even for the ones who do, it doesn't explain the wage gap https://t.co/IMZDSICDxeMaybe it's changing demographics?\n\nThe workforce has changed a lot since 1973. Many women entered the workforce for the first time, and if they got paid less maybe that'd lower the avg wage.\n\nBut women's income is actually rising as fast as productivity, so that's likely not it. https://t.co/pKGAyNWWwKMaybe it's some esoteric mismeasurement problem that either explains most of it or all of it away: https://t.co/WxsZweycfv\n\n\"Depending on how you prefer to think about inflation, median wages have probably risen about 40% \u2013 50% since 1973, about half as much as productivity.\"Maybe it's just increasing Labor-Vs-Capital inequality?\n\nLabor-vs-capital inequality is about how much wage earners earn vs. how much capitalists get in profits.\n\nBut that inequality started decreasing in 2000s, when wages and productivity really decoupled, so that's not it.Maybe just old-fashioned wage inequality?\n\nWell, if you add in total compensation, the avg worker is doing almost as well as they did in 1973\n\nA few high-earners are taking a lot of the pie, keeping the mean constant but lowering the median. This is probably the biggest factor. https://t.co/AjOZ32rKLK\"Remember, productivity has grown by 70-100% through this period. So even though the top 5% have seen their incomes grow by 69%, they\u2019re still not growing as fast as productivity. The top 1% have grown slightly faster than productivity, but the top 0.1% are doing the best.\"Or is wage inequality increasing b/c technology is automating middle-class jobs and pushing them to lower-class jobs?\n\nMaybe somewhat. It explains some top-10% people doing  better, but it doesn't explain the top-1% performance.Maybe policy changes are exacerbating the decoupling?\n\nSome people point to:\n\n- Decline in unions\n- Lack of corporate governance preventing CEO-pay restrictions\n- Tax changes (When there are higher taxes, CEOs negotiate less?)Even taking out mismeasurement, there is still decoupling btw median wages &amp; productivity. \n\nMost important factor is probably wage inequality, followed by other breakdowns. Here's Scott's breakdown: https://t.co/hFAXfxhouXRelated: https://t.co/CVeAHA1X2V",

So take your time.\n\nSince you can't compete w/ Google, you want to find ppl that Google isn't chasing after but have even more talent &amp; grit\n\nLike drafting Tom Brady in 6th roundWhat to look for in hires\n\n- High slope &amp; learning velocity\n- Drive &amp; grit\n- Bias to action\n- Micro-pessimist, Macro-optimist:https://t.co/bxOE9PkUgv\n- High integrity &amp; low ego\n- Curious\n- Not only good, but known as good (so they can attract other great ppl)\n- Long-term orientedBefore you even start sourcing, make sure you have a good JD &amp; reason why you want to spend $100K-200K hiring someone, b/c this should be last resort.\n\nClearly articulate what success looks like. If they're in the role for 12 months, how do you know that they've been successful?Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for.Treat recruiting like a funnel.\n\nDiagram the entire experience &amp; identify potential leakage.\n\nIf you interview lots of ppl but don't make offers, that's either a poor evaluation process and/or sourcing problem\n\nIf you make offers but don't convert, something's wrong w/ your closeSourcing: \n\n- If you don't have a good enough top of funnel, then you end up compromising at the bottom of the funnel\n\n- Sell managers on the benefits of knowing how to do their own sourcing. (\"If you want to be a leader, you'll have to recruit)\n\n- Throw referral sourcing partiesSourcing:\n\n- Hire in-house recruiter early. Ask sourcers to have 100 targets per wk.\n\n- Like GTM, experiment w/ diff channels &amp; double down\n\n- Spend time w/ ideal passive candidates, recruiting over long time horizon\n\n- Qualify leads (\"Comp expectations? Ideal role &amp; location\"?)Building a interview process:\n\nTreat it like a scientific experiment\u2014You have a control group and you keep the criteria the same.\n\nMake sure that these candidates are asked the same questions in the same order. And you're evaluating them on the same thing so you can compare them.Have a \"scorecard\" that has the attributes you're looking for in the candidate per position, how much they matter, &amp; split up interviews accordingly.\n\nWhatever your hiring process is, codify it, and make sure everyone has access to it.\n\nBefore interviews, have Q's ahead of time.Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Decide too quickly whether they should hire this person or not. That's why it's important to have a checklist\n\n- Pick five qualities that you want to hire for and design questions for every quality. Have interviewers rate 1-5 &amp; compare. Calibrate ratersSample interview Q's:\n\n- If you were me, what kind of candidate would you be looking for?\n- If you joined &amp; then left in 3 months, why would that be?\n- What was your last boss like? How would they describe you?\n\nMore: https://t.co/xb3ov86rI1\n\nNot these ;) https://t.co/TlnuElQQ7kTop grade interview:\n\nPast performance is indicative of future performance, so dig in.\n\nGo through last 5 jobs &amp; ask:\n\n\"What were your accomplishments? Struggles? Who did you work closely w/ &amp; how would they rate the candidate from 1-10, in your opinion?\"\n\nThen reference.Reference philosophy:\n\n- On &amp; off-book references.\n\n- Decrease defensiveness to get better answers. Start by saying \"We really like X and we'd be excited to work w/ them. Curious to ask Q's to best set them up for success.\"\n\n- Do video to see body language.Q's to ask references:\n\n- How do they react to frustration?\n\n- What would that person's critic say? or last performance review?\n\n- Describe the ideal role?\n\n- Is this top 5% ppl you've worked w/? or Rate 1-10 but no 7.\n\n- If this didn't work out, why not?\n\nhttps://t.co/VvDjCR2hp9When referencing:\n\n- Sell the reference giver on why it's such an amazing opportunity!\n\n- Ask them for referrals for other great ppl that should join\n\n- Consider recruiting them if they are a fit &amp; seem interested!\n\n- Close the loop when you make them an offer. Make them an ally.Mistakes founders make: not optimizing candidate experience.\n\nWhen you interview the candidate, the candidate is selling you. But you should also be selling them\n\nNot only does that help you close the ppl you want to hire, but actually creates like word of mouth effect for othersHow to give a great candidate experience\n\n- Clear expectations of role across team\n- Consistent communication\n- Transparent &amp; sensible process\n- Social time w/ the team\n- Respect their time, particularly w/ take home work\n- Make them feel special, not a cog\n- Quality interviewsClosing candidates:\n\nIf you're unable to close candidates, then all else is meaningless.\n\nIt's also demoralizing to existing employees who interview the candidates (\"If they don't want to work here, why am I?\"\n\nSell the mission, the team, &amp; the opportunity. Make it compelling.Closing:\n\n- Aim for ~70% close rate.\n\n- Only make an offer when you're sure they'll accept. (\"If we give you X,Y, Z, would you accept?\")\n\n- Identify who influences their decision and take them out to dinner w/ candidate (spouse? peer?)\n\n- Enlist reference as an ally in closing.Closing:\n\nHave the investor sell the candidate on why they invested, why it'll be an enormous outcome, &amp; how they think about the team from an \"unbiased\" POV, and how the investor likes to invest in their employees future career success (perhaps even back their eventual startup)!Closing:\n\n- Q4 is best time to recruit. Holidays are reflective, post Q4 bonus, ppl are most ready to jump\n\n- Weather also helps. NYC kid comes in winter to SF &amp; sees sunshine...\n\n- 4 yr vest is natural, but don't be shy 1 mo after ppl join new co, in case it wasn't the right fitMistakes founders make:\n\n- Not allocating enough time to recruiting, esp. passive candidates.\n\n- CEOs think they have to build, but after they raise money their job is to hire people who can build.\n\n- Over 50% of founder's time should be spent hiring. They rarely spend enough.A hire isn't truly a hire until they've completed 90 day plan.\n\nHave them write 1st draft of their annual review and co-define what success looks like, then back into a 90 day plan (which should have been backed into from the job description)\n\nIf after 90 days not good, can cut.Double down on your stars &amp; promote within\n\nIf you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is more important than trying to fix ppl who won't create 10x value.\n\nManagement drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employeesMistakes founders make:\n\n- Hiring too senior, too soon, when they try to do big co things in a small co setting.\n\n- Hiring too senior too late is also bad b/c you got builders but you don't know what you should be building &amp; how to scale &amp; implement processesMistake people make when hiring head of recruiting:\n\nHiring someone from FB/Google and expecting same output.\n\nFind me someone who can sell a company with no brand and less pay.\n\nEasy to sell ice cream.

    "full_text": "Here are favorite takeaways &amp; quotes from Sam Altman interviews\n\nIt takes 10yrs to create a great startup. If you don\u2019t love &amp; believe it, you\u2019ll likely give up at some point along the way. There\u2019s no way I know of to get through the pain without a belief that the mission mattersOn Risk:\n\nMost people in the world will try to pull you back &amp; say, \u2018That seems a little too crazy'\n\nAt the end of the day, most ppl serve to pull you back towards the mean\n\nMost ppl tend to either be wrong abt what is/isn\u2019t risky or aren\u2019t taking enough risks (especially early)Most ppl are too risk-averse, and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths\n\nRisk: Also, let\u2019s re-define risk:\n\nI think what risk actually looks like is not doing something that you will then spend the rest of your life regrettingIt\u2019s easy to spend a decade being busy &amp; stressed every day, &amp; feeling like you\u2019re working hard and creating a ton of movement, but not moving forward.\n\nToo many ppl get caught up in the idea of \u201cworking hard\u201d w/o taking a pause to make sure they\u2019re moving in the right direction.Productivity:\n\nThis whole productivity porn thing where you have systems and multi-variable charts and 3-dimensional whatever, those people never seem to be the people that move the world forward\n\nMinimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don\u2019t really matter.The best ideas sound terrible at first\n\nBut this a good thing (it means there\u2019s less competition)\n\nAlso, the truly good ideas don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re worth stealing (so don\u2019t be afraid to share your idea with others)The best ideas are usually either very different from existing companies in one meaningful way or totally new\n\nIf it takes more than a sentence to explain what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s almost always a sign that it\u2019s too complicatedPeople use employee count as a metric for startup success\u2014this is wrong\n\nYou should instead be proud of how few employees you have.\u00a0Lots of employees equals a high burn rate\u2014meaning you\u2019re losing lots of money every month, complexity, tension, and slow decision-makingMediocre people at a big company cause some problems\u2014they don\u2019t usually kill the company.\u00a0\n\nA single mediocre hire out of your first five will often, in fact, kill a startup\n\nWith every early hire, ask: \u201cAm I willing to bet the future of the company on this one hire?Qualities in team:\n\nOptimists: The whole world will be telling you why you\u2019re going to fail as a startup. You need that internal fire of belief\n\nIdea Generators: Can generate solutions to solve problems\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve Got It\u201d: Ppl on your team who are always willing to step up to the job\"People that run companies are either a good leader or a good manager. I think I\u2019m a good leader and a bad manager.\"\n\nI think the best thing you can do is realize that, as a first-time founder, you\u2019re likely to be a terrible manager, &amp; then try to overcompensate for thatBeing super generous with early employee equity, and getting founder-quality people as the first 10 employees, I think all the evidence is on the side of doing this, and yet, almost no one does. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge edge if you\u2019re willing to do it.5 Jobs of a Startup CEO:\n\n- Set the vision\n- Raise money\n- Evangelize\n- Hire &amp; manage\n- Make sure the entire company executes\n\nAs a founder, you\u2019ll have 100s of important things competing for your attention\u2014your job is to identify the most critical, work on them, &amp; defer the restOn Evangelism:\n\nSomeone at the startup must be able to recruit, sell the product, talk to the press, raise money, etc.\n\nThis requires someone who can affect the whole world with enthusiasm about what the company\u2019s trying to doYou want a company to be winning all the time. If you ever take the foot off the gas pedal, things will spiral out of control and snowball downwards. A winning team feels good and keeps winning; a team that hasn\u2019t won in a while gets demotivated and keeps losing. \n\nKeep momentum!How to keep momentum:\n\nEstablish an operating rhythm\u2014ship product and launch new features weekly\n\nIgnore competitors (until they\u2019re beating you with a shipped product)\n\nCompetitors making noise is often what crushes a company\u2019s momentum more than any external factorThe number 1 lesson startups need is that the degree to which you\u2019re successful approximates the degree to which you build a product that\u2019s so good, ppl spontaneously tell their friends abt it\n\nPpl are more likely to tell their friends abt a product when it\u2019s easy to explainReal Trends vs. Fake Trends\n\nWith real trends, a new piece of tech comes along, &amp; the early adopters use it obsessively (and tell their friends how much they love it) (e.g iPhone)\n\nA fake trend is one where people may buy the product, but don\u2019t use it all that often (e.g. oculus)\"I learn pretty well by reading, but I learn much better by talking to the experts\"\n\nIf you send a thoughtful email, one that shows you\u2019re serious and have done some work, to somebody working at the edge of a particular field on something interesting, they\u2019ll probably meet you.Not only do I think it\u2019s possible to start a hard tech startup, it\u2019s actually easier to start a hard startup than it is to start an easier startup.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re doing something that makes people\u2019s eyes gloss over, it\u2019s hard to hire, it\u2019s hard to stake holders to care, etcAlmost every VC firm gives advice they never follow themselves:\n\nThey don\u2019t build differentiated products, they are not network affected businesses, they don\u2019t try to build a brand and a community, and they don\u2019t try to make something that gets better the bigger it getsI think one thing that is an important thing to strive for is being internally driven, being driven to compete with yourself, not with other people. If you compete with other people, you end up in this mimetic trap, and you sort of play this tournament, and if you win, you loseWhen to pivot?\n\nWhen you\u2019ve run out of ideas AND something isn\u2019t working, then it\u2019s a good time to stop\n\nMost great companies start with a great idea, not a pivot. If you look at the track record of pivots, they don\u2019t usually become big companies.Nuclear Energy, why is it unpopular?\n\nBc most ppl are bad at estimating risk. They'll happily breathe in coal smoke all day &amp; then someday die of cancer, &amp; not connect that together. But if there\u2019s a nuclear meltdown &amp; 3 people die, they will march against nuclear energy foreverIf you work hard at the beginning of your career, &amp; you get a little better at what you do every day, every week, every year, &amp; learn more, &amp; meet more people, &amp; get more done, there's a compound effect. It\u2019s better to put that time in at the beginning of your career than the end",

But he didnt/couldnt overturn it\n\nInstead he called a truce.Reagan ended up satisfying both constitutions by paying for it via debt.\n\nCombination of Raegan tax cuts plus social programs plus competing with Russia put us in debt. \n\nHe tried to have his cake &amp; eat it too, which worked temporarily, but future generations had to pay for it.\"So overwhelming is the hegemony of this 1964 constitution over the 1788 constitution, that our politics has pretty naturally sorted itself.\n\ninto a party of those who have been helped by the new constitutional developments and the party of those who have been harmed by it.\"In light of all this, it's interesting to think about intersectionality &amp; identity politics as not just cultural or intellectual fashions/belief systems, but also, among other things, legal strategies adaptive to their environments, thanks to 1964.The book then goes on to chronicle how Clinton accelerated it, how not much happened under Bush here, how Obama accelerated it\u2014and the book conveniently ends right before Trump is elected.\n\n/FIN. \n\nInterested in hearing responses to Caldwell's ideas",

That the terms have shifted.\n\n\u201cTruth\u201d is a myth. \u201cReason\u201d is a white male Eurocentric construct. \u201cEquality\u201d is a mask for oppressions. \u201cPeace\u201d and \u201cProgress\u201d are met w/ reminders of power.\n\nFar left &amp; far right are converging.\n\nSmithsonian: https://t.co/kiZ8SMujClHow did post-modernism come about? Hicks traces the history by starting w/ Kant.\n\nKant asserted that people couldn't perceive reality outside of the mind. It was all subjective.\n\nTo speak of truth as an external relationship between mind and reality is nonsense, Kant claimedOf the five major features of Enlightenment reason\u2014objectivity, competence, autonomy, universality, and being an individual faculty\u2014Kant rejects objectivity. \n\nOnce reason is so severed from reality, the rest is\ndetails\u2014details that are worked out over the next two centuries.After Kant it was Hegel.\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s focused on epistemology, Hegel\u2019s focused on  metaphysics. \n\n- Reality is subjective and has contradictions\n- Since reality evolves contradictorily, truth is relative to time &amp; place\n- The collective, not the individual, is the operative unitThe postmodernists abandoned Hegel's metaphysics * put Nietzschean power struggles at the core of our being. \n\nAnd especially in the cases of Foucault &amp; Derrida, most postmodernists abandoned Nietzsche \u2019s sense of the exalted potential of man &amp; embraced Heidegger\u2019s anti-humanism.Note this was a 180 for the far left:\n\nSocialism accepted evidence, reason, logic, tolerance, and civility. \n\nIt was only when socialism performed so badly that those tools became enemies, because they were no longer useful to furthering socialism.Socialists argued that capitalism was driven by a logic of competitive exploitation that would cause its eventual collapse and that socialism\u2019s communal form of production, by contrast, would prove to be economically superior.\n\nThey hoped for an eventual class war that never cameMorally, capitalism was evil both because of the self-interested motives of those engaged in competition and b/c  of the exploitation and alienation that competition caused.\n\nSocialism, by contrast, would be based on selfless sacrifice and communal sharing.\n\n...This didn't happenSo reason had nothing to offer the far-left.\n\nWhat mattered now was will, authentic, and non-rational commitment.\n\nMarxism failed. Class was not strong enough binder to foment a revolution. So the left rebranded to focusing on identity groups, which were more binding &amp; permanent https://t.co/oQ7sP5jkyyIf one is interested in truth , then one\u2019s rational response to a failing theory is as follows:\n\n- Break down theory into its premises, question them vigorously and check the logic that integrates them.\n- Seek out alternatives\n- Accept moral responsibility for consequences.But they'd rather throw out truth altogether.\n\nEchoing Dostoyevski, \"If the truth was outside of Christ,\nI would rather remain with Christ than with the truth.\u201d\n\nBoth religion and socialism started with a comprehensive\nvision that they believed to be true but not based on reasonPost-modernists are the new sophists.\n\nThe Sophists taught rhetoric not as a means of advancing truth and knowledge but as a means of winning\ndebates in the rough-and-tumble world of day-to-day politics.Coming after two millennia of Christianity and two centuries of socialist theory\u2014post modernists believe that  Subjectivism and relativism are true, except\nthat the postmodernists are on the side of the weaker and\nhistorically-oppressed groups.Consider the following claims. \n\nOn the one hand, all truth is relative; on the other hand, postmodernism tells it like it really is. \n\nOn the one hand, all cultures are equally deserving of respect; on the other, Western culture is uniquely destructive and bad.(Cont):\n\nTechnology is bad and destructive\u2014and it is unfair that some people have more than others. \n\nTolerance is good and dominance is bad\u2014but when postmodernists come to power, thought police follows.\n\nSubjectivism and relativism in one breath, dogmatic absolutism in the next.",

The labor cost to build a home is actually\u00a0higher today\u00a0than it was in the 1960s.In California, just transactional efficiency isn't enough. Why? It actually raises price.\n\nYou also need construction productivity.\n\nIn particular, there've been promising advances in two areas: modular housing and so-called tiny homes.Real estate agents have a bit of a racket going\n\nIf you're selling a house, it's 3%. If you're buying a house, it's 3%. They legally can't take less, regardless of work needed\n\nWeirdly, they're incentivized for you to pay more for a house, rather than less. Should be the opposite https://t.co/O9Xe79jxgBWhy does it currently suck to buy a house?\n\nAmong other reasons, if you're taking out a mortgage, you have to get approved, which can take 45 days. \n\nWhich means you can lose out on the house to someone who can pay right away, even if you were willing to pay more for it. https://t.co/P75pVKp4w9Companies will buy &amp; sell homes on behalf of ppl\n\nFlyhomes buys the house *for* you. Perfect for supply constrained markets. (Seattle)\n\nOpendoor buys the house *from* you. Perfect for demand constrained markets.

This is nature's way of telling you that these algorithms have escaped our control. The fact that the people who are in a position know what the algorithm does, can't even protect themselves...We are not built to be happy. \n\nAnd therefore, pursuing happiness, as if we were built to be happy is a hazard. We should be pursuing something else. \n\nWe should recognize that happiness is a carrot on a stick, that evolution built into us in order to get us to pursue objectives.Metaphorical Truth:\n\nA belief that is factually wrong, but that if you behave as if it were correct, you'd come out ahead of where you would be\n\nWhat makes a concept useful evolutionarily is not that it is accurate, but that it's advantageous.\n\nhttps://t.co/nTEmneXBaDReligion is metaphorically true.\n\nIf it wasn't, if it was useless, than those who simply didn't believe them would have a massive advantage b/c they weren't spending all this time on elaborate rituals, etc. It must provide some evolutionary advantage. It's not just a mind virus.On excesses of cancel culture:\n\nWhat you want is a system in which ppl are honorable. \n\nif you allow honorable ppl to be skewered simply b/c someone decides to go after them, you're going to eliminate the courageous ppl from the system.\n\nDon't let the innocent go down w/ the shipOn humor: \n\nWe don't even have a good evolutionary explanation of what humor is\n\nAnd so we're trying to navigate what the rules of it should be without even talking about what its function is.\n\nhypothesis: laughter is the sound of comprehension.That is to say: \n\nHumor treads at the edge, the fringe of consciousness, and that what happens when a comic finds a truly funny joke, is that they're unearthing a truth that people are only kind of aware of but it's so universal that the whole room suddenly grasps it.Humor is the mechanism by which we sort out the gray area\n\nIf you cut that off and say, 'you can't say that', well, then, how exactly do we figure out where the line is? \n\nOne has to step beyond the line to figure out where the line is,&amp; if the room laughs, now you know somethingCRISPR gives us the typewriter, it allows us to edit, maybe it's the word processor, but what we don't have is the Rosetta Stone. \n\nhow can we edit the computer if we don't understand the source code?On evolution:\n\nCulture is every bit as biological as genes are. \n\nHard to distinguish b/c many things have components that live in both spaces. \n\nBut you have to realize that most of what we are is the product of an evolutionary adaptive process, irrespective of  genes or cultureUtopia\n\nAnytime you try to maximize a single parameter, every other value you have will crash as a result\n\nBut once you accept that, you can say, you really like liberty, but you're not ready to surrender on equality\n\nYou can have 80% of both, if you accept imperfection in eitherComplex dynamic systems are always about tensions between competing values. I mean, this is how your body works. Your temperature is maintained by something that looks out for it being too hot and too cold, &amp; it's constantly pushing parameters around that you're not even aware ofIf you build a rule into your personality, where you say anything that is positive from the perspective of equity is something you're in favor of, then you can be easily manipulated, because all that has to happen is somebody needs to wrap that label around something noxious.Tribalism:\n\nThere's playful versions of tribalism that we wouldn't want to get over (e.g sports?), but clearly when we take it too far it becomes fanaticism. \n\nIt's hard: The worst thing about us, the same parameter that makes a mother love her children, makes ppl commit genocideAnd so when ppl are involved in these tribal movements, they're operating automatically, they're pursuing ends that something inside them tells them to pursue\n\nAnd if they realized that sometimes ppl who felt just like they did put other people in gas chambers, maybe they'd stopWisdom involves, I would argue, delayed gratification, unpacking the issue carefully is the way not to get sucked into these movements that are pursuing ends that we should never wish for.Evolution:\n\nThe first thing to do is to get over the idea that you want to fulfill evolutions wish for you, it's an absurd wish.\n\nI am not exaggerating to say that every single creature that has ever evolved has the identical same purpose, which means it can't be a very good one.We must recognize that we are in an odd spot evolutionarily:\n\nEvolution has awarded us the capacity to evaluate our purpose &amp; reject it, which we should do right away. \n\nHaving rejected it, we can substitute other things. And that leads right to the Q of well, what to substitute?Most ppl agree on basic values, they will disagree about what policies ought to be used to enact them\n\nWe'd rather pursue common values than we would pursue our evolutionary program, which is not honorable, can't be defended, and is ultimately a danger to our persistence.You have two lefts: the authoritarian left &amp; libertarian left:\n\nThose that wish to end oppression &amp; those that wish to turn the tables of oppression\n\nThere are those that want to use enforce equality of outcome vs enable equality of opportunity\n\n(Of course, devil's in details...)\"Where's my progressivism? My progressivism is in the idea that opportunity is not at all widely distributed at this moment, and that we need to remedy that if the system is to function at all...

No price transparency. Principal agent problems abound.Why is healthcare so hard?\n\nSo many middle men.\n\nEnterprise = b2b\nConsumer = b2c\nHealthcare = b2b2R2Pc2P2c\n\nBiopharma (Development) \u2014&gt; Regulator (FDA) \u2014&gt; Payer (insurance, employers, gov\u2019t ) \u2014&gt; Channel (pharmacy) -&gt; Provider (physicians, hospitals) \u2014&gt; customer (patient)\n\nh/t a16zWhy is healthcare so hard?\n\nIt's like any startup, except everything is 10x harder:\n\nRegulation is tighter, incumbents are more protected, customers move slower, and behaviors are harder to change. \n\nAnd barely any early adopters to sell to! \n\nWhich is why many go full-stack.Malay Gandhi wrote a fantastic piece about why there haven't been enough unicorns--they've played too close to existing system. \n\nhttps://t.co/W2wzhzPIL1\n\nCompanies need to own outcomes. See attached. https://t.co/pas7jrdogvLife science industry is the exception to the rule: you can build a huge business working w/ existing industry.\n\nopportunities in every part of the value chain from drug discovery, clinical trials, commercialization, production, fulfillment, drug pricing, etc.Initially, companies set out to triage things out of existing healthcare ecosystem and build a layer around them.\n\nNext wave focusing on reimagining care from within or from inside out.\n\nStill, more than 30% of costs flow through hospitals. Can unbundle.Unbundling hospitals:\n\n- Most expensive part of healthcare is labor.\n\n- Find ways for physicians to get out of hospitals and closer to patients (e.g. handle back-office, create lower-cost models of running an office)Future of providers involves bifurcation:\n\nEither doctors will go sell to major hospital systems.\n\nOr they'll go w/ insurance companies &amp; cut value based deals.\n\nBig opportunity to help doctors do the latter.\n\nAlso: Virtual clinics (virtual fertility, mental health, pain)Payers:\n\n- 10% of patients account for &gt;50% of costs\n\n- Don't have updated provider networks\n\n- Tough time managing fraud\n\n- Don't have advanced way to do risk segmentation\n\nAre notoriously tough customers so have to make sure can integrate easily w/ existing way of doing things.Consumer: \n\nWhen are we going to see something that  combines telemedicine, wearables, and at home diagnostics so you can properly triage patients and then escalate them properly to the right domain of care for that level of severity?\n\nWhen are we gonna get indexed health data?Consumer:\n\nWhen are we going to see a d2c company that genetically tests you when you\u2019re born and then focuses on optimizing your well-being, mental cognition, and physical abilities for the rest of your life?\n\nhttps://t.co/saQa0UWWIOConsumer:\n\nImagine taking genomic data &amp; lab data and combining it with information from your Apple Watch or another wearable and some app telling you that your blood sugar is low or that you're dehydrated or that you haven't slept enough or that you need to eat X.Our view of healthcare is so narrow.\n\nIt's optimized for acute care (when you're sick, or something's broken), not preventive care.\n\nIn theory, apps like Foursquare (food), Strava (exercise) &amp; Tinder (relationships) should be tied to our health profiles.Build inside or outside the system?\n\nYou either have to be:\n\n1) full stack (take on the entire vertical of pharmacy, clinical trials, insurance, etc.) \n\nor 2) barely touching the existing healthcare system\n\nFramework h/t @nikillinit:\"If you want to simplify the pharmacy, then you have to be a delivery system, distributor, &amp; PBM all in one.\n\nif you want to do insurance, you have to get into care itself.\n\nif you want to be in the clinical trial space, you have to be someone that runs the clinical trial itself\"\"OR, you operate tangentially next to healthcare space\n\neither in primary care (one medical, nurx etc.) which doesn't have to touch the existing system unless it absolutely needs to, which means it can build its own systems in house\"Another framework:\n\nEither you commit to going through heavy amounts of proof building (clinical trials, pilots, publishing in peer reviewed journals) OR you go direct to consumer and gather millions of users like any other consumer app. Both brutally hard.One Medical for X:\n\n- One Medical worked b/c it was a great perk for employers to offer their employees.\n\n- Consumers won't pay for any commodity specialist. It has to be something where there's high variance in quality (e.g diabetes, musculoskeletal, mental health, dental)Nurx for X:\n\nTraditional mail order pharmacy brands haven't innovated on distribution. They don't have direct relationship w/ consumers.\n\nNew brands are segmenting against category as a result (Hims &amp; ED, Brightside &amp; mental health, Nurx &amp; women's health)EMR:\n\nEpic will continue to dominate for a long time b/c hard to rip out (exception here is primary care)\n\nStandard value of Epic is not to make a doctor's life easier. It's to do revenue cycle management properly.Opportunity: Legitimize &amp; Curate alternative-eastern medicine.\n\nBig demand from consumers, a lot of it is snake oil.\n\nA company can solve for access, quality, and guidance.Distribution:\n\nSo many great products fail in healthcare b/c no one cares.\n\nIt must fit within an existing budget item or reimbursement code that they provide to the market around the service.\n\nSelf-insured employer channel is crowdedMany companies struggle going d2c, then try to go b2b, but typically fail b/c they just haven't solved a strong enough pain point for the consumer. That's why d2c didn't work.Paraphrasing Cunningham's law, which explains why I post some of these: \"The best way to get the right answer on the internet isn't to ask general questions.

And every time I meet a priest, he wants to talk about sex\u201d\n\nWhatever it is that you deny yourself will become your new prisonWhen getting started in your career, try to learn something that people haven\u2019t quite figured out how to teachDevelop an owner/founder mentality\n\nMost people say, \u201cI\u2019m not the founder. I\u2019m not being paid enough to care.\u201d\n\nBut you are.\u00a0The knowledge and skills you gain by developing a founder mentality set you up to be a founder down the line, and it pays you in that sense.When you\u2019re negotiating with other people, ultimately if someone else is making a decision about how to compensate you, that decision will be based on how replaceable you are\n\nIf you have high leverage, that makes you less replaceable (and you\u2019ll likely get more equity)How to get leverage (or specific knowledge that makes you indispensable?)\n\nGet it permisionlessly \u2013 learn to code, create podcasts, become a good writer\n\nThrough permission \u2013 get people to work for you, or raise capitalSpecific Knowledge Can Be Timely or Timeless\n\nTimely: Machine learning\n\nTimeless: Persuasion\n\nTimeless specific knowledge skills usually can\u2019t be taught (but sticks with you forever); timely specific knowledge skills come and go (but still have a fairly long shelf life)Companies don\u2019t know how to measure outputs, so they measure inputs instead. \n\nWork in a way that your outputs are visible and measurable. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have accountability, do something different.\n\ni.e be in a position where ppl can tell what role you had in a company\u2019s successThe entire structure of rewarding people comes from the agricultural and industrial age, where your inputs and outputs matched up very closely. \n\nThe amount of hours that you put into doing something was a good/rough proxy for what kind of output you\u2019d get.Today, things are much more non-linear (and as a result, judgment and accountability matter much more):\n\nA good investment decision can make a company millions\n\nOne useful product feature can be the difference between product-market fit and complete failureHumans have a need to be highly consistent with their past pronouncements.\n\nIf you want to\u00a0 do something \u2013 tell people about it because they\u2019ll hold you accountableGig economy:\n\nThere will come a day when you roll out of bed, you get an alert on your phone with a new gig, you sign up for it, you get paid in crypto, and you do your work in VR. \n\nYou work when you want, where you want, how you want, and with whom you want.The Q is not whether automation is going to eliminate jobs\n\nThere is no finite number of jobs\n\nNew jobs are being created, + they\u2019re usually better, more creative jobs\n\nThe Q is \u2013 how quickly will this transition happen, what jobs will be eliminated, &amp; what jobs will be created?The internet does two things simultaneously: Aggregate &amp; atomize\n\nIn other words, before the internet, industries tended to have few large players\n\nBut now, we have one internet company in charge that runs everything, and next to that company, there are millions of small playersWhat does this mean?\n\nWe may be heading toward a world in which, if you\u2019re employed, your employer is either one of these gargantuan companies that\u2019s running an entire industry, or you\u2019re self-employed. There won\u2019t be that much in between.Early employees at a startup often take on the same risk that a founder does without the compensation, control, and  visibility.\n\nThey should think like founders (or VCs!) in terms of diligencing the cos they're considering joining.On product:\n\nIf something isn\u2019t working, if the community you want isn\u2019t emerging, then you probably need to go back and remove something much more than you need to add something\n\nA lot of the great companies replace complexity with simplicity for the end-userCapitalism is innate to the human species in every exchange we have\n\nThe notion of exchange and keeping track of credits and debits \u2013 this is built into us as flexible social animals\n\nMarkets are what enable cooperation at scale, across genetic boundaries.You\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. It usually means you're replaceable.\n\nYou should own equity to gain your financial freedom.\n\nIt's hard to become truly wealthy when your inputs are closely tied to your outputs, b/c when you're sleeping, you're not earning.Get rich by giving society what it doesn\u2019t yet know how to get \u2013 at scale\n\nSociety always wants new things &amp; if you want to be wealthy, figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get, but it will want, &amp; that\u2019s natural to youThe internet connects everyone on the planet\n\nThis means that you can find an audience for your product no matter how far away they are\n\nAt the same time, so can everyone else\n\nThis is why you need to escape competition through authenticity. No one can compete w/ you on being youWhen you combine things you\u2019re not supposed to combine, ppl get interested\n\nJoe Rogan: Comedian, podcaster, &amp; UFC commentator\n\nTake the things you're natural at &amp; combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest &amp; enjoyment, end up at the top in a few things\u201cWe\u2019re coming out of a factory-based industrial world that was built in the 1800s under a one size fits all model for efficiency reasons and we\u2019re heading into a boutique artisanal world where 7 billion people will want 7 billion products\u201dWe descended from pessimists\n\nIf 2 ppl were in a forest 10,000 yrs ago, &amp; they hear a tiger \u2013 the optimist stays &amp; gets eaten, while the pessimist runs &amp; survives\n\nIt made sense to be pessimistic in the past, but it makes sense to be an optimist today. (Safer)\n\nRewire accordinglyToday, we\u2019re in situations which have capped downside &amp; unlimited upside\n\nIf you create the next FB, you can create billions. If you fail, you can often pick up right where you were\n\nThis risk equation is the opposite of what we used to have--which is our risk instinct is warpedSpecific Knowledge is knowledge that makes you irreplaceable.\n\nYou can\u2019t be trained for it, otherwise someone would learn it and replace you.\n\nTo gain specific knowledge, quadruple down on the stuff that feels like play to you but looks like work to othersBuffet once went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free so he could learn about investing\n\nGraham told him \u2013 \u201cActually you\u2019re overpriced. Free is overpriced.\u201d\n\nApprenticeships are VALUABLE \u2013 if specific knowledge can somehow be taught, this is how\u201cIf you care about ethics in wealth creation, it\u2019s better to create your wealth using code and media as leverage. Then those products are equally available to everybody as opposed to trying to create your wealth through labor or capital.\u201dFirst aim to get leverage, and once you have leverage \u2013 your judgment becomes the most important skill\n\nJudgment is the exercise of wisdom\n\nWisdom comes from experience\n\nThat experience can be accelerated through short iterationsYou should be too busy to do coffee while keeping an uncluttered calendar\n\nSpend your time doing only what YOU can uniquely do\n\nI need 4-5 hours of time by myself every day doing NOTHING. Because if I don\u2019t have that time, I won\u2019t be able to do ANYTHING.On Advice:\n\nReject most advice, but remember you have to listen to/read enough of it to know what to reject and what to accept. All of it cancels out\n\nWhen you hear a piece of advice, ask yourself:\n\u25aa\u201cIs this true?\u201d\n\u25aa\u201cIs it true in my context?\u201d\n\u25aa\u201cDo I want to apply it?\u201dIn general, avoid getting into situations where you\u2019re sacrificing today for an imagined tomorrowWhenever you\u2019re doing anything in business, if you\u2019re looking towards the long-term of getting wealthy, you should ask:\n\n\u201cIs this authentic to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it myself that I\u2019m projecting? Am I productizing it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I scaling it w/ labor or w/ capital or w/ code or w/ media?\u201dThe Biggest Illusions of Life\n\nIllusion #1: Meaning: We're all gonna die, what's the meaning?\n\nIllusion #2: Free will: \"Free Will\" is just our DNA reacting to the environment\n\nIllusion #3: Reality: It's possible we\u2019re living in a simulationInformation overload:\n\nThe brain is not designed to absorb all of the world\u2019s breaking news &amp; emergencies, injected straight into the skull with clickbait headlines. If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you have a sound mind &amp; body, it will eventually drive you insaneAll our diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity\n\nPascal has said \u2013 \u201cAll of man\u2019s problems arise because he can\u2019t sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a primate from a small planet circling a star in the Milky Way galaxy...I was fortunate enough to realize (the American Dream) by becoming a tech entrepreneur and angel investor. And like every person as they get older and wiser, I\u2019m now turning into a pseudo philosopher\"\u201cEducation should be free at this point. The idea that you need to pay $250K to sacrifice 4 years of your life so a professor can lecture you in a lecture hall is ABSURD.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the best teacher in the world will teach everyone in the world about that given topic\"The bigger problem this generation will face is adult education, not child education\n\nChildren are learning machines \u2013 they just need the tools.\n\nFor adults, all the tools are there. \n\nIt\u2019s the desire to learn that\u2019s scarceThe smaller the company you work for, the happier you\u2019ll be\n\nWhy? \u2013 Better relationships, fewer rules, and more creative freedom\n\nMore accountability (and it\u2019s more visible)\n\nYou\u2019re easily able to try multiple things to see what you\u2019re good at\n\nMore flexibility &amp; authenticity\"I don\u2019t care how rich you are. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a top Wall Street banker. If somebody has to tell you when to be at work, what to wear and how to behave, you\u2019re not a free person. You\u2019re not actually rich.\u201dI don\u2019t have a typical day nor do I want a typical day\n\nI\u2019m trying to get rid of the concept of having to be at a specific place at a specific time\n\nAll I care about is am I doing what I want to do, am I being productive, and am I happyWhat you do &amp; who you do it with is WAY more important than how hard you work\n\nWork isn\u2019t linear: 8 hours of input does not equate to the same output for every single person\n\nInstead of working 9-5 like a machine, work like a lion: Train hard, sprint, rest, &amp; reassess. Repeat.Set an aspirational hourly rate for yourself and stick to it\n\nIf I have to return something, and it costs less than my personal hourly rate, I\u2019ll throw or give it away\u201d\n\nIf you need to do a task, but can hire someone for less than your hourly rate \u2013 hire themI think everybody should have kids.

(e.g. Thumbtack, Fiverr)\n\nManaged Marketplaces integrated w/ supply or owned supply outright (e.g. Honor, Clutter) https://t.co/zKAxOTer3NManaged Marketplaces:\n\nBear take: Capital intensive, lower margins, less scalable, handicap network effects b/c you commoditize supply \n\nBull take: It's a more controlled &amp; thus higher quality experience, can do lower margins if TAM is in trillions (e.g. healthcareVertical marketplaces:\n\nEnable a 10x better experience.\n\nFor example, you could buy tickets on Craigslist &amp; eBay.\n\nBut Stubhub integrated w/ ticket providers so you could also verify identity and get seating charts.\n\nSlice does this for pizza ordering.Vertical marketplaces\n\n\"1- Look at large horizontal marketplaces, identify the verticals w/ low NPS, &amp; use product to leapfrog the liquidity of the incumbent\u2019s supply base\n\n2- Nail a small, overlooked and under-appreciated niche, then land &amp; expand from there\"\n\n- @sarahtavelVertical vs Horizontal Marketplaces:\n\nIf you play this out 10 years, can you imagine people have 20 apps for different service categories on their phone? Probably not.\n\nSo vertical marketplaces either likely have to expand and become horizontal, or get acquired.Double commit marketplaces: Marketplaces that pick supply for you (e.g. Uber).\n\nIf you do enough work, it looks like the marketplace is the provider rather than the individual suppliers (e.g. Amazon).\n\nFor this to work you need to highly curate supply and  match effectively.B2B Marketplaces:\n\nWhy Now? \n\n- After 10+ yrs of consumer marketplaces, we're finally getting to b2b.\n\n- Today's business owners are more tech-savvy.\n\n- B2B requires domain experience to see the opportunity, unlike consumer\n\n- Selling to SMEs where they are fragmented.Factors of a Healthy Marketplace:\n\n- Fragmented supply\n- Not prone to monogamy (e.g babysitters)\n- User experience has to be 10x better than status quo\n- Low friction for supplier to sign up\n- High frequency &amp; high AOV\n- In the payments flow\n- Good reason to stay on platformLabor Marketplaces:\n\n- If you're successful, you lose a customer (they get a job). Thus more of a marketing play\n\n- Vertical marketplaces unbundling LinkedIn can work if they offer value beyond job (e.g RigUp creates a network of profiles for the industry, including reviews etc)Human capital marketplaces:\n\nBiggest underutilized asset of all time is people's time: https://t.co/LkmbaVK5wi\n\nP2P Marketplaces: https://t.co/iowARJuJ1S\n\nLots of data that can be leveraged for people matching (e.g what I'm reading, purchasing, etc)Building marketplaces:\n\n- Identify \"red hot center\" - the group that feels the pain most acutely b/c they'll jump through hoops to use the product initially.\n\n- Main way to create magic for demand is to have the right supply. If you have exclusive lock over supply, that's a moat.How to solve Chicken &amp; Egg problem:\n\nConstrain marketplace to a geo or category you can own\n\nNail one side of the marketplace (usually supply)\n\nBiggest way to grow supply is sales ppl.\n\nBiggest way to grow demand is word of mouth--or when supply brings demand (e.g. Eventbrite)Liquidity is what matters:\n\nCraigslist even w/ horrible experience did $1B last yr b/c of liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is basically how well that you can satisfy user demand. How well supply and demand value props match. Conversion rate is one proxy for that.Redefine the atomic unit of supply and therefore dramatically expand the addressable supply.\n\nHomeAway stayed limited to vacation home rentals until Airbnb redefined and expanded the atomic unit of supply which enabled them to own it instead of share it. \n\nhttps://t.co/ZRes9bhCkdCorrect post link here: https://t.co/1fTp9xa5Um",

However, unless you\u2019re the NYT, trying to do everything is a recipe for failing at everything\n\nThese strategies require diff approachesOn one side you will have the aggregators as ideal vehicles for content creators who value reach; on the other new kinds of tools that enable direct connection\u2014&amp; funding\u2014from fans. Maybe this whole Internet thing will turn out pretty good after all\u2026unless you\u2019re a publisher.Video is safer b/c it's very expensive to produce (or buy rights to), so hard to substitute \n\nVideo has been increasingly differentiating itself on either quality (HBO) or exclusivity (ESPN)\n\nThe value of tech cos in each space is inversely proportional to value of the publishersThe rule of thumb around marketplace businesses is that you either have a low take rate and high margins or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge w/ Neither/New companies (e.g WeWork) end up with relatively low take rates combined w/ relatively mediocre margins.\n\nhttps://t.co/hANITRohrXAnd that's what's wrong w/ Microsoft. It\u2019s not they don\u2019t have talent\u2014they do. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have great tech\u2014they do.\n\nRather, it\u2019s that they achieved their goal. There IS a computer on every desk &amp; in very home, &amp; nearly all of them run Microsoft software. \n\nNow what?Microsoft: \n\nI am skeptical that Microsoft\u2019s antitrust issues were a major factor in Microsoft missing mobile; the company had the wrong approach, both in terms of product and business model.Twitter:\n\nSince finding PM-fit came so easily, Twitter still has no idea what their market actually is, and how they might expand it.\n\nTwitter is the company-equivalent of a lottery winner who never actually learns how to make money, and now they are starting to pay the price.Twitter had huge potential:\n\nWhereas Google is valuable because it knows what I want, when I want to get it, Facebook knows who I am, and who I know. \n\nTwitter, on the other hand, knows exactly what I like and what I\u2019m interested in.Twitter had problems scaling growth b/c of their onboarding experience, so they focused on maximizing monetization per user:\n\nIt's a challenge to get ppl to re-try a product they have already dismissed. \n\nIn the meantime, they have to monetize the users they haveEconomics of software: massive fixed cost, effectively zero marginal costs.\n\nIt was expensive to develop Windows, but Microsoft could reuse the software on all computers; every new computer sold was pure profit.It was expensive to build Google, but search can be extended to anyone with an Internet connection; every new user was an opportunity to show more ads.\n\nIt was expensive to build Facebook, but the network can scale to two billion people and counting, all of which can be shown adsThey let others handle less profitable marginal components, at least initially\n\nGoogle builds the search engine and leaves the creation of web pages to be searched to the rest of the world\n\nFB builds the infrastructure of the network, &amp; leaves the content creation to its usersPoliticians designed for the TV age \u2014 i.e meant to be palatable to the greatest # of ppl \u2014 are at a disadvantage on platforms like FB. \n\nThe Politicians that win inspire passion, stirring up a level of engagement that breaks through on a scale that far exceeds an ad buy.\"It\u2019s a really cool ad about ppl creating that kinda forgot to say how Dropbox makes that all possible, kinda like how Dropbox built a really great product that solved a real problem but kinda forgot\u2014or more generously, waited far 2 long\u2014to build a huge sustainable biz around it\"Apple is all about focus, Amazon is The Everything Store.\n\nApple has high margins, Amazon says \"your margins are my opportunity.\" \n\nApple is a product co that struggles w services, Amazon is a service co that struggles w product.\n\nMultiple ways to be successful./FIN\n\nBarely scratching the surface here.

The question is, Is it the right time for my idea to happen?\"A startup isn\u2019t a company until it hacks its way through 3 distinct miracles:\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n1) The insight hack (insight development)\n\n2) The value hack (customer development)\n\n3) Growth hacking (going from 0-1 to 1-X)Value hacking:\n\nFigure out what you can uniquely do that ppl are desperate for\n\nIdentify a focus group of customers that desperately need your solution\n\nIterate &amp; improve your value proposition relentlessly until you start to see signs of exponential organic growthIf your value prop as a startup isn\u2019t true enough, &amp; your customer isn\u2019t desperate enough, you won\u2019t grow exponentially. You\u2019ll instead have to spend $ to overcome the objections to the gaps in your value prop.\n\nOnly think about growth after you\u2019ve proven your value hypothesis.On ideas:\n\nMost people are looking around their present world and searching for \"white space\" -- \"startup opportunity\". \n\nInstead, live in the future, find what's missing, and then show people the way forward.It might be time to start your startup when:\n\nYou have insider knowledge about a major change event.\n\nYou know the market opportunity and customer needs in a visceral way.\n\nYou have a vision of a problem to be solved based on your knowledge of the first two pointsHow do you know when it\u2019s time to double down on an idea?\n\nWhen no one can talk you out of doing it\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone reasonable who can talk you out of it, you\u2019re probably not ready for it\n\nOr when the pain of regret from not trying &gt; any possible pain experienced from failing\"Sometimes the world puts an opportunity in front of you that you\u2019re in a unique position to capitalize on before others, that leverages a unique domain skill you have, and takes advantage of something you\u2019ve seen before others because of your vantage point. It\u2019s tempting to say:\"You\u2019ll tackle it when you\u2019re ready\u2014when you have your things in place, when you have your ducks in a row, when the economy is more stable \u2026 But the reality is, if you plan to start something great, these kinds of opportunities are extremely rare\u2014maybe even once in a lifetime.\"The startup law of the jungle:\n\nStartups are initially very vulnerable to predators (like a newborn animal on the plains)\u00a0\n\nBeing non-consensus and right affords the startup the time to survive, adapt, and &amp; \u2013 no one preys on them because no one believes their idea\u2019s importantWith your product, have a good answer to the question:\u00a0\u201cWhat job do our customers hire this product to do?\u201d\n\nWhen you buy a new product, you hire it to help you do a job\n\nIf the product does the job well, you\u2019ll tend to hire it again\n\nIf it does a bad job, you\u2019ll fire itWhen you\u2019re starting a startup, you\u2019re going to war together. You gotta know you want to be in the fox hole with this person. You GOTTA know it. Because it\u2019s impossible enough as it is. A lot of these startups fail because the founders can\u2019t see eye to eye on what has to happenLaunching Paradox:\n\n\"If you aren\u2019t embarrassed by your product, then you launched too late\u201d - Reid Hoffman\n\nBut Steve Jobs &amp; Apple are the opposite: perfectionism. \n\nThe former approach works better when you\u2019re the only person showing up with something they\u2019re desperate forWhy Nows\n\nTechnology inflections: When Mike invested in\u00a0Lyft, GPS locators in cell phones had just gotten good enough for ride-sharing\n\nAdoption inflections: Also contributing to Lyft was the fact that nearly everyone had smartphones.Navigate the Idea Maze: \n\nAssume every idea's been tried, and ask why now or why you would have a different outcome.\n\nQ's to ask:\n\nWhy did it fail?\nWhat were the assumptions? \nWhy are my assumptions different?\nHow is the world different in a way that may change the outcome?On capital intensiveness: \n\nI like ideas where you can light a forest fire with just a match. I think that on some level, the true measure of the disruptive power of an idea is the degree to which it can make change without throwing money at it.Fundamentally, a startup is all about harnessing exponential change to create a unique value proposition ppl are desperate for, that changes their point of view, &amp; grows at hyper-warp speed, all done by ppl who live in the future. This has been remarkably true for remarkably longMost decisions are one of two types \u2013 70/30 or 51/49\n\nIf it\u2019s 70/30, you know what you need to do \u2013 you\u2019re just, for whatever reason, not courageous enough to follow through on it\n\nIf it\u2019s 51/49, it almost doesn\u2019t matter which one you pickPeople don\u2019t make the wrong decision b/c they don\u2019t have the facts/framework, they do so because they let their emotions get attached to the decision in a way that interferes w/ their judgement.Quite often, decisions are more simple than you realize \u2013 it\u2019s the willingness to follow through that really matters more than anything else\n\nThe only wrong decision is no decision\n\nThe quickest way down the path is to make the leap \u2013 you can course correct later if need beStop putting your decisions off \u2013 Courage doesn\u2019t grow with time.\n\nIf you\u2019re deliberating constantly on a really hard decision, it\u2019s probably because it really doesn\u2019t matter what you chooseIt\u2019s good to have a plan, but life has a way of not caring. You want to have a strategy, but secrets emerge and bubble up all around you, &amp; sometimes you find a secret in the wild better than the secret you were pursuing and you need to have the presence of mind to know it.I enjoy trying to find the set of people out there in Silicon Valley who have the Jedi skills of knowing what\u2019s going to happen &amp; what\u2019s interesting.\n\nIt\u2019s less important to\u00a0be\u00a0the best expert, it\u2019s more important to\u00a0know\u00a0the best expert &amp; have good taste as to who that is.\u201cI would love to find a way to fund 0 to 1 projects that seem impossible, but if pulled off have a transformative effect on the world\u2026things that seem like an impossible dream, but if you have the right money and funding mechanism, you could do it.\"We\u2019ve progressively moved away from \u2018sound money'\n\nThis started ~10 years before the Great Depression when the Fed began manipulating interest rates\n\nWhy did they start doing this? \u2013 To impact how much money was/wasn\u2019t being borrowed which would in turn affect the economyFor most things, price is set by supply and demand \u2013 money shouldn't be different.\n\nWhen an interest rate is set, it should be based on what the bank believes to be the valid price for money based on the supply &amp; demand.\n\nMoney is the most important thing to price in the economy.Due to the low interest rates, many Fortune 500 companies are borrowing money to buy back their own stock\n\nLast year alone, $800 billion was used in this way\n\nThis money could be used in better ways \u2013 like investing in new products, breakthrough ideas and job creating innovationsThe result of this- fake company growth (by increasing a company\u2019s stock price)\n\nWhen you buy back your own stock \u2013 you\u2019re not doing anything for the employees (you\u2019re just jacking up the share price)So the side effect of this \u2013 \u201cMost of the innovation at Fortune 500 companies are at best sustaining innovations or efficiency innovations where they\u2019re trying to remove labor from certain processes\u201dI believe that the lack of soundness of our money has done way more to create wealth inequality than most people realize\n\nIf interest rates were set by supply and demand, they\u2019d certainly be higher (and so would the investment returns for many citizens)The standard of living had increased ~14 fold from 1850 to 2000: More abundance created than in all of history combined.\n\nCorporate Capitalism (Mass production) is largely responsible.\n\n\u201cNetwork capitalism\u201d (Mass computation/connectivity) will be responsible for the next wave.I don\u2019t believe robots are going to eat the jobs as much as they\u2019re going to eat the need for people to join companies\n\nInstead of putting ppl out of work, Tech will give solo-entrepreneurs the tools to not\u00a0need\u00a0to have a job (help finding clients, aid them with billing, etc.)I think there\u2019s going to be a bull market of side hustles soon\u2026 From your iPad you can start recording a podcast, publish written word to anyone around the world\u2026.it\u2019s mind blowing what we\u2019ve done over the last 20 years for the individual",

Ongoing thread \ud83d\udc47The whole concept of a real name is a social construct, imposed externally to track ppl\n\nIt used to be that you used whatever name you wanted in whatever village you were going &amp; you could always reboot\n\nIn some cultures, knowing real name of something was to have power over itSatoshi was the first pseudonymous billionaire &amp; won't be the last.\n\nWhat Satoshi did by using a pseudonym is he made sure that everyone focused on the technology and the ideas he put out there, not on his celebrity, basically eliminating ad hominem attacks against him,If your bank account is your store wealth, your real name is your stored reputation. \n\nWhat digital currency will unlock is the ability to have intermediates. \n\nYou don't need to wager your entire bank account or your entire real name on something anymore.Prediction markets will help keep media accountable:\n\nCurrently, there's a strong disincentive for speaking the truth if it makes your in-group look worse or your out-group look better.\n\nFinancial incentives help counteract those tribal incentives.We are a nation of immigrants, but also emigrants.\n\nSince Mobile makes us more mobile, &amp; law is a function of latitude &amp; longitude, it's cheaper to change the law under which you live\n\nThe way to do that used to be by voting, but exit is becoming easier, which also empowers voiceVoice really matters when people are leaving in droves.  \n\nW/o exit it\u2019s mostly symbolic. Or it becomes revolution.\n\nSovereign Individual enables libertarian founder to rebuild the state.Parable of seen &amp; unseen: Takes more empathy &amp; imagination to think about the value that isn't created as a result of regulation, relative to value the regulation saves\n\n(e.g self-driving cars prevent countless  deaths, but might introduce a few new ones. Easy calculus. And yet.)W/o risk-taking, you keep the few that might die from it, but you don\u2019t get the cure that will save the masses\n\nThe promise of charter cities to create spaces for this asymmetric risk-taking. \n\nThis in a nutshell is why we need parallel institutions across the boardAdvice on metrics: \n\nWhen you pick a North Star metric, make sure to include a second measure of quality to compensate for possible gaming of the first metric.\n\nE.g. if you incentivize salespeople on revenue, also pick a metric related to, say, customer feedback or churnBus #: how many ppl can get hit by a bus &amp; startup continu\n\nOnce bus # is more than 1 for every position, you have to view ppl as replaceable.\n\nThat's a critical transition that happens in companies where they evolve from a collection of individuals to a multi celled organism.What happens in Sovereign Individual world:\n\nGood things \u2014 Society based on choice &amp; consent. Citizen becomes customer. \n\nBad things \u2014 criminals gain new technology too. \n\nPunchline: More upside &amp; more downside. But net positive, and increased global equality of opportunity.Can\u2019t you seize BTC? You have to:\n\n1- identify person\n\n2- find a way to take private key from person \n\nit shifts the logic of violence, where it used to be that if you had the biggest military, you could take the most money, But not as easy anymore. \n\nhttps://t.co/GahhwvSM8kBest movements combine best of the right (substance) &amp; left (optics)\n\nHierarchy, capitalism, meritocracy, profit *and* egalitarianism, mission-driven, community ethos, &amp; storytelling.Crypto enables new economic opportunities: \n\nMore information asymmetry means more liquidity which means you can rent out your time.\n\nAny down time you could convert into money just based on how hard you're willing to work\n\nPress button, get work.The communist manifesto asked \"wouldn't it be great if you could be a hunter in the morning, and a tailor at night, &amp; switch through many different professions?\" \n\nWhat if you could actually do that in such a way that didn't involve killing millions of people, like communism did?Voice &amp; Exit illuminated:\n\nVoice is voting, Exit is immigration \n\nVoice is making a bug report, Exit is forking \n\nVoice is trying to do turnaround of a company, Exit is leaving to start your ownVR will be to crypto what the iPhone was to the internet. \n\nThe internet was going but post 2008 w/ iPhone apps where people can program for, internet exploded\n\neverything became more useful when you could do it in a mobile form factor (email, twitter, google maps)When have your virtual reality and virtual currency. What you get is a virtual economy, right? \n\nAnd now, via telepresence  you can now have somebody be a migrant worker without actually having to leave their family,\n\nImmigration policy is now your firewallBullish on perfumes and food because we are conditioned to sight and sound and some extent touch via haptics but scent will be harder to replicate.Is VR implausible?\n\nConsider Twitter in 2007, ppl tweeting abt breakfast.\n\nThe idea that ppl would get fired over tweets, that significant fraction of news would be wrappers over tweets, that politics would shift from offline to this online war zone\u2014that too seemed implausible.Internet increases variance in everything: You'll get more upside &amp; more downside\n\ne.g. We used to have 30-minute sitcom, we now have 10 second GIFS &amp; 10-hour Netflix binges. 10 min wrap up podcasts and 3 hr long interview shows.Twitter is a library combined w/ civil war. \n\nYou're here studying &amp; ppl are just shooting at each other &amp; sometimes you'll tweet something meant for other learners &amp; a war zone participant will catch wind &amp; shoot at you &amp; try to pull you into the ongoing worldwide social war.Tiebout sorting - model for how to solve free rider problem in politics where folks can move btw jurisdictions to the one that suits their preference\n\nTreats ballot not as something to be aggregated alone, but as a search query\n\nThis is happening online already w/ social neworkse.g here is preferred tax rate, abortion policy, etc &amp; rather than aggregate with ppl local to you, you treat it as a search query where you can find ppl who share values. \n\nFinding ideological patriots in the cloud &amp; then migrating to live w/ them will be story of 21st centurySocial Network Supply Chain\u2014visualize yourself &amp; then visualize all the nodes around you\u2014co-workers, investors, friends\u2014&amp; look at these folks and ask which of them would go south in the event of a negative news article coming from this or that political directionAn additional model of diversity: 1,000 different micro cities that are pure examples of different ways of living.Cloud formations taking physical shape:\n\n2 ppl meeting for a day\u2014ppl meet on LinkedIn &amp; get coffee\n\n2 ppl for a yr\u2014EHarmony\n\n100K ppl for a day\u2014Protest\n\n100K ppl for a week\u2014Burning Man.\n\nNo upper limit to scale &amp; duration. 100K ppl can live together for yrs = cloud cities.Another example of best of left &amp; right: Singapore healthcare is both far to the left and far to the right of the American system\n\nLeft = compulsory savings account\n\nRight = once that money is there in HSA, it\u2019s free market capitalism from there on (insurance, reimbursement, etc)Why are the free speech people sometimes reprehensible? \n\nCriminalize freedom of speech, and, among the people who will pursue, many will be criminals.\n\nNot a reflection of the merits of freedom of speech, even though restrictions on them will paint it in a poor light.The meta thing is to hold as a highest value is choice/exit\n\nThat is to say, if you choose to be in a society that has a centralized government and that works for you, wonderful \n\nif you choose to be in a basically a commune, and people could actually make that work, wonderful.To be sure, the right to emigrate at all times doesn't necessarily mean the right to immigrate at all times \n\nHarvard doesn't have open borders. Neither does the New York Times. You can't just go and walk in and get a job or admission there.Glen Weyl's view: Exit is never meaningful without other people. If exit is done collectively, voice is involved in organizing that collective exit.Crowd choice: \n\n\"If we all move there, your tax rate is currently 10%? Can you knock it down to 9.5?\" And we'll all move there. They'll . calculate it and say, okay, I can discount it and we'll lose $ here, but we'll make it up on volume, boom, it's win win\"Imagine a world where they've invented the ability to  have  flying cars that are very fast so that you can very quickly move across physical jurisdictions. \n\nAt that point, it starts becoming just meaningless to have geographically bounded nation states.What would end up happening is that people would subscribe to different nation states services, which then would negotiate with each other the terms on which their members will interact with each other, and people would be a member of one or more anyways.To reiterate: \n\nmobile is making this more mobile, and law is a function of latitude and longitude. \n\nSo if it's cheaper to change your x&amp;y location, it's cheaper it also change the law under which you live \n\nTwo ways to opt out of current location: VR &amp; physically moving.In the long term, nation states eventually become commoditized providers of land (e.g uranium) and rule sets (laws), and you can kind of pick among them.\n\nthen finally, the true borders of a community are no longer the geographical borders, but the ideological borders.Critiques of libertarianism:\n\n1- Non-aggression principle: if somebody first strikes you and knocks off your head, then you can even retaliate. So if you're just premised on retaliation, you're not going to spread. Communists were definitely willing to first strike and so onCritiques of libertarianism:\n\n2- \"Live &amp; let live\" is not a winning ideology. Galt's Gulch is a retreat\n\nAs opposed to a tactical placing your foot back to then drive forward w more energy\n\nE.g. we'll move to America, build up there &amp; then come back into Europe like 100yrs later\"I'm convinced by public choice theory--I don't think that many of these regulations are today at least optimized for the consumer I think they're optimized for optics, a person ascending some higher regulatory position\n\nI think very few of them are actually consumer protecting\"Re: drug policy\n\nNetherlands model: drugs are basically legalized.\n\nSingapore model: execute drug smugglers.  \n\nThose are extreme left or right--what US does is take the worst kind the left and the right (e.g. healthcare)Technocracy is inevitable: \n\nif I install software, I know on some level a software engineer wrote this, but think much more implicit is that in yours and everybody's head, some political engineer, some meme-genius, installed memes in our head we can' even trace the origin of.Ideal property law changes: allow for diff kinds of system administrators to experiment w/ diff kinds of property law. \n\ne.g. Twitter 2.0 w/ marketplace for usernames. \n\ne.g. The earlier you sign up for FB, more $ you get. \n\nLots of things that work in practice, but not in theoryDifferent things you need to optimize in society: \n\nThe first is the path of the citizen: vote w their ballot, vote w their wallet, vote w their feet. I think that's important that we have all three options or they can choose among their leaders.2nd: You need paths for ambitious young people to become leaders. \n\nwhat's great about the whole startup world is it takes these ambitious young megalomaniacs and it puts them into something where their their actions are actually mostly pro social.For example, there is a prominent tech founder who was a huge email spammer in college and has now become a tech billionaire. \n\nThe criminal breaks rules in order to destroy an entrepreneur breaks rules in order to build\n\nSocieties need paths to become a citizen &amp; a leaderPeople want good regulation:\n\nYou don't want to test everything yourself. you want to do  diligence on a regulator &amp; then just kind of trust after that point.\n\nWhat regulators deliver as a product is basically a form of star ratings, and some form of bands of bad actors.The most valuable companies in the last 20 years have actually all been cloud rather than land regulators.\n\nGoogle regulates the web, filters out malware\n\neBay regulator of their own marketplace, filtering out bad actors.\n\nUber &amp; Airbnb have star ratingsRidesharing is interesting b/c it's a hybrid of the regulator &amp; the marketplace\n\nmultiple different legal regimes that exist at the same x comma y location at the same latitude and longitude.\n\non your phone, you can opt into different taxi regulatory regimes w the tap of buttonRe: responding to market failure, it's actually good to tolerate a bit of anarchy.\n\nby tolerating a period of anarchy, you usually develop a technological solution that's superior to imposing a misaligned third party. \n\nEmail spam works this way.Monopolies have civilizational diabetes: too much abundance takes away drive\u2014can't get to infinity unless you know what 0 is\n\nShirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in 3 generations: 1st becomes wealthy, 2nd inherits some work ethic, &amp; 3rd becomes spoiled kids who've never known hardshipMonopolies generate tons of money\n\nAnd that money attracts parasites, folks who, in a weird, rational kind of way, want maximum compensation for minimum effort, and that huge amount of wealth now starts getting eaten from within by termites\n\nAnd so disruption takes care of itselfThere's a lot of tech companies are just going to get killed by crypto over the next 20 years. \n\nThere's so many different areas that crypto gives you tools to attack: Encryption. Property Rights. Governance. Balance.The most important data structure in SV is the cap table\n\nA few hundred strangers on a cap table can build Google\n\nCrypto can increase the scale of those cap tables by 1,000x. \n\nFrom aligning a few hundred ppl to millions of people. \n\nWhat could that enable? Sovereign CollectivesSovereign Collectives: \n\n20,000 Amazon engineers worth was enough to bring NYC to the bargaining table. NY is 27 million person state. Why did they care about 20,000 people?\n\nProbably made economic sense. Shows that small amounts of coordinated ppl can influence law.tech ethos (win &amp; help win) is neither progressive nor conservative /libertarian. \n\nprogressives would would deny win-win, see world as zero-sum.\n\nconservatives/libertarians are not as ambitious or collective (prefer live and let live)Progressives are generally against inequality and concentration of wealth and corporate power. \n\nAnd libertarians/conservatives are often against centralization, and concentration of state power.\n\nCrypto aims to decentralize both.In economics there's this concept called the solo convergence theorem: all economies converge as a model. \n\nI'm not sure that's real in economics, but I know it's real on Twitter: all ideologies converge the same ideology (the sick burn, the dunk, \"let me get this straight\")B/c Twitter turns us into monsters.\n\nWhat's funny is even if you actively try to not do this, the 1% of the time you do it will be the tweet that seen by, like 80% of people, right?\n\nAnd what happens is, people even if they don't realize it, subconsciously respond to incentives.Satoshi should not actually be analogized to a religious leader, like Jesus, but instead somebody like Newton or Einstein. \n\nThey're someone who's worthy of respect, but also can be wrong, and should be!\n\nNewton probably would have been tickled that Einstein corrected his theory.Consider a policeman or teacher having their savings go to a pension fund, who then puts it into a VC, which then goes &amp; puts it into a startup.\n\nW/ crypto, that teacher, if they choose, can go straight to the startup. They can still go the old route, but now they have a choice.Folks are primed for egalitarianism when they are being selected (\"equality!\"), and they're primed for elitism when they are doing the selecting\n\nWhen selecting, they don\u2019t just want a average school for their kid, they want the best school. Not a random doctor, the best doctor.So when you turn everybody into investors, you make everyone a selector. That's a massive shift.\n\nThey're thinking about wealth &amp; value creation, which involves downside as well as upside.\n\nThey appreciate that $ doesn't grow on trees, &amp; it's hard to make(w/o printing or taxing).Contrasting French &amp; American Revolutions:\n\nThe French Revolution was like, we want food, give that to us. But didn't change until regime changed.\n\nAmerican revolution said, we want legitimacy. So ppl experimented w/ democracies &amp; made a better system that replaced existing one.The French Revolution was like a pure left revolution, but the American Revolution was a balance of left and right.\n\nAnd so it was both all men are created equal *and* no taxation without representation.\n\nDynamism/inspiration of the left &amp; practicality/concreteness of the right.Not a libertarian.\n\nThe ideal is a competent, centralized government, which you can sign the social contract with the terms of service by immigrating there. \n\nIf the best is a competent centralized gov't, the worst is a malicious centralized gov't\n\nhttps://t.co/rGG3666Dq0U.S. has not seen great leadership in a long time.\n\nPeak of USA was bracketed by 1933 (Hoover Dam) and 1968 (Manhattan Project)\n\nPeak Centralization.\n\nIn between a competent and incompetent centralized government is the decentralized response.",

Nowadays, most economists think it\u2019s much lower (~0.4%).If you have a growth rate that\u2019s 1% lower, over the course of a bit more than a century, you could have been 3x richer with the higher growth rate. \n\nThat\u2019s a difference between the U.S. today and MexicoI don\u2019t think economic growth is always positive, but America has serious problems. \n\nI\u2019d rather address those problems with more resources, rather than fewer, whether paying off our debts, addressing climate change, or fixing global povertyHow can we enhance growth?\n\nBy making it easier to build homes &amp; move to big cities (enhancing opportunity/geographic mobility)\n\nIt\u2019s extremely difficult to pack up &amp; head somewhere like the Bay Area &amp; just hope to get a job (this was much easier ~50 ago)\n\ncc @placementRelated: In 1980, 40% of people moved somewhere when starting a new career; last year, only 1 in 10 people moved after accepting a new job offer\n\nOne reason for this: costs of movement + housing costs have increased, especially in our most productive regionsFunding science is incredibly important, but there\u2019s little research into\u00a0how\u00a0exactly we should be doing so\u00a0\n\ne.g. in 1980, NIH spent 12x more dollars on researchers under 40 than those over 50. Today, this has inverted \u2013 they spend 5x more dollars on ppl over 50 than ppl over 40Over the past 100 years, there\u2019s been tremendous progress in medical research\n\nThe average life expectancy has increased by ~1/4 year of every year, &amp; relatively linearly\n\nBut, Tyler brings up a good point:\u00a0We use to spend a few % points of our GDP on healthcare, now we spend 18%All of the following have grown linearly over the last 100 years: # of PhDs, totals $ spent on funded science, and # of published papers\u00a0\n\nBut no corresponding increase in terms of scientific progress.When NY decided to build a subway in 1900,  they opened 23 subway stations in 5 yrs for ~$1B\n\nWhen NY decided to build a 2nd Avenue subway in 2000, 3 stations in 17 yrs &amp; spent $4.5 billion doing so\n\nProductivity in regards to subway construction decreased by a factor of 40The percentage of Americans who think their kid\u2019s lives will be better than their\u2019s has been declining since World War II\n\nThis lost sense of optimism about the future results in people investing less and not working as hard",

So was evolution, the world is round, etcAn open conversation allows millions of minds to go to work on these offensive ideas &amp; find the few gold nuggets, the needles in the haystack and throw the rest away.\n\nBut even for the dumb ideas\u2014the best way to eliminate them is to bring them to light so they can be fought.B/c suppression doesn\u2019t change minds\n\nYou may suppress for a while, but you won\u2019t change minds (they may double down actually), &amp; once they have power, they may silence you.\n\nYou should only create a system that you\u2019d be OK w/ in the hands of your enemy, because 1 day it will be.When you curtail free speech, what happens is that you weaken the quest for knowledge and moral improvement, and knowledge and moral improvement is ultimately the solution to eliminating hate\n\nHate comes out of fear and out of ignorance. And you fight that with knowledge.There is a long history behind censoring &amp; punishing ppl for what they say &amp; it's not good: Think China, Russia, Germany at their worst moments\n\nInstead of saying that curtailing free speech doesn't cause much harm, make the case for how censorship has led to \nmore moral progressFree speech doesn't mean \"freedom of consequences\"\n\nBut we should not let their \"consequences\" also prevent moral progress\n\nIf we want moral progress, we must respond to arguments w/ counter arguments, not bullets (economic), b/c those same bullets can be used at us &amp; our speechLet's give one example of the marketplace of ideas in action: Gay rights\n\nRemember, most people in America once believed homosexuality was a mental illness, &amp; that pro-gay speech was bigoted. They wanted to prevent these ideas from entering the marketplace.\"Hold them accountable\"Jonathan Rauch believes the US has done a better job w/ gay rights than Europe because in the US we could\nidentify the hate, confront the fears underlying it, and contrasting the truth against it&amp;discredit hate in ppl minds\u2014That's what we did.\n\n\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant\u201dConsider this story to illustrate the point:\n\nIn 1957 a man named Frank Kameny is fired from his government job as an astronomer, and he's fired because he's gay. No other reason, but because he's gay.\n\nSo remember gay people in this time were treated very poorly:They were arrested in their own homes for making love to each other (&amp; got criminal records), they'd get openly beaten on the streets, and if they called the police, the police would often join in the fun, arrest the gay person instead of the person who committed the crime.Back to Frank Kameny. He never served as an astronomer again. That was expected\n\nBut what was unexpected was that he did not back down.\n\nHe believed that the Declaration of Independence was a personal promise that the founders had made to him and he decided to ensure his promiseSo he began an opposition movement. He appealed his firing to the US government. He failed. He appealed it to the Supreme Court. He failed. He appealed to Congress. He failed &amp; received letters saying \u201cof all the letters I've ever received, yours is the most disgusting\u201dFrank says, I went to Europe to fight tyranny overseas, only to come home and discover that I must now fight the tyranny in the US.\n\nSo he then begins representing other gay people who've been fired from their jobs because he's determined. He will win in the marketplace of ideas.In 1965 Frank and some other people led the first peaceful, openly gay protest with a protest march in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nin 1970, Frank's the first openly gay person to run for Congress. He loses, but he keeps pushing for the cause. He knows he's right.He challenges the psychiatric diagnosis of homosexuality as a disease. He does all this stuff for years, and no one ever listens\n\nUntil they do start listening! In the 70s, people begin to notice what he &amp; other gay activists are saying\n\nHis ideas start winning in the marketplaceAs society held its prejudice to critical scrutiny, over enough time the prejudice lost its appeal. It just didn't make sense. As soon as it did, the dominoes of hate started to fall, and within a generation people can't believe we ever had a problem w/ gay marriage.So Frank Kameny died in 2011 at age 86. \n\nHe lived long enough not only to see same sex marriage be legal in multiple states, and to see sodomy laws overturn, and to see gay people serving in US government in secure positions and to see gay people serve in the military\u2014\n\nIn 2009\u2014He lived long enough to receive a formal apology from the US gov't from the very agency that fired him\n\nHe received their Roosevelt prize for public service\u2014their highest prize\n\nAnd best of all, the director of the agency that had fired him that was now apologizing was openly gaySo this is the power of free speech and the marketplace of ideas.\n\nFrank didn't have money. He didn't have anything but the power of his ideas &amp; a marketplace to compete in. \n\nAnd that is the thing we must protect if we want to sustainably change minds and enable moral progress./FIN\n\nFor those who want to go deeper, I recommend reading:  @jon_rauch's book \"Kindly Inquisitors\". Much of the above is inspired by &amp; summarizing his work: https://t.co/N7HduzBEJo\n\n@Ayishat_Akanbi is also inspiring on the topic: https://t.co/ayAtU3P8PI",

Gotta be something else.Two kinds of checks on population growth, positive &amp; negative.\n\nPositive checks are things that kill people (e.g. war, famine, disease)\n\nNegative checks are things that slow birth rate (e.g. when people get poorer, they tend to marry less and have less kids)Interestingly, once there are downswings in population, it takes a bit before they rise again\n\nThere's another process involved that leads to extended downswings: Elite Overproduction\n\nBacking up: When there are too many people, food is scarce, but jobs too, causing wages to fallA fall in wages are bad for workers, but good for elites: they can hire more workers for the same amount of $.\n\nWhen elites are better off, they are likely to marry earlier &amp; have bigger families\n\nSo when ordinary people are struggling due to overpopulation, the elite is booming.So the amount of elites take up a bigger fraction of overall population.\n\nThe problem w/ this expansion of the elite is that society only has room for a certain amount.\n\nAs the elite expands, there's growing pressure to find roles for them, so that they can keep their lifestyles.The state steps in to provide the excess elite with positions appropriate for their status.\n\nAnd that of course costs money because they need salaries sufficient to support elite lifestyles.\n\nA huge increase in # of elites means huge increase in govt expenses to fill these roles.As the elite continues to expand and the state struggles to find roles for them all, you get an intense competition for these positions.\n\nMany elites lose out on $ &amp; status they expected to get, making them very angry and leading them to turn on each other in intra-elite conflictA visible sign of this is an emphasis on credentialing.\n\nIn the old days when most of the elite youth could expect to inherit their parents wealth &amp; status, they didn't bother to go to university. \n\nBut w/ over-expansion, they now fight for credentials to separate them.Overpopulation isn't the only way we get an expansion of elite.\n\nThe American Dream is another way, the idea that anyone can earn their way to the elite.\n\nGlobalization amplifies this significantly.\n\nThe internet even more so. Now the whole world is competing to be an elite.Revolutions don't occur b/c masses are poor &amp; angry.\n\nThe elite control the army, so they can keep down the masses.\n\nRevolutions occur when there's intra elite competition.\n\nLeading to a counter elite, who, feeling entitled to $ they won't get, want to ensure others won't either.If you want to explain when social breakdowns occur, you need to look at 3 things (Political Stress Index):\n\n1- Mass mobilization potential (food shortages and falling wages)\n\n2- Elite mobilization potential (over-expansion and competition for status) \n\n3-  State fiscal distressMore on state fiscal distress: \n\nAs state needs to spend more on elite, it has a hard time raising taxes b/c poor are also needy.\n\nIt can't afford to keep the elite happy and alleviate hunger and suppress unrest, and these problems of funding the state contribute to its collapse.To summarize:\n\nPopulation expands until it reaches the Malthusian limit.\n\nThis means wages fall &amp; labor is cheap, which leads to high mass mobilization potential.\n\nOverpopulation also leads to elite over-expansion and thus intra-elite competition.This leads to increased state expenditure to take care of elites, which means they need to raise taxes at the same time that the masses are poorer and *they* also need more govt services\n\nIt ends in breakdown &amp; population collapse, taking you back to underpopulation &amp; small elitePeter Turchin has also written a book applying the theory to the United States. American Civil War fits this theory\n\nStructural Demographic Theory used to take 2 centuries, but now takes 150 years, which means U.S. is getting pretty close to political breakdown &amp; social calamity.This analysis may seem strange.\n\nIsn't it a problem that rich people (&amp; everyone) are having too *few* kids? \n\nThe bigger problem is that productivity growth isn't rising enough to support their growth relative to overall population growth.Humans landed on the moon 50 yrs ago. But spaceflight remains a marginal activity with just a few astronauts in space at a time. \n\nCompare that w/ how in 50 yrs you went from the first powered aircraft to a global airline industry, already carrying 10s of millions of ppl a year.If we had continued to develop spaceflight and lunar exploration, that would have created lots of jobs, as well as opened up new resources, including abundant solar energy and metals and other valuable materials on the moon. And that would have absorbed the increase in populationSignals of elite overexpansion: University attendance.\n\nIn UK since 1990, population increased by 15%, but the # of students increased by almost 100%.\n\nin 1990, American Law school grads had even distribution of salaries, but by 2000 there was a separation into winners &amp; losers.Both far leftists &amp; far rightists comprise the counter-elite.\n\nThey consider themselves entitled to elite privileges, but the state can't absorb them. \n\nAnd since they seem destined to remain outside privilege, oppose it: If they can't be a part of it, they want to destroy it.Because the cycle isn't over yet, we should expect a full blown political crisis, &amp; then a general breakdown and reset.\n\nEither a positive check (increase in death rate) and/or a negative check (decrease in birth rate)\n\nOne solution is economic growth: https://t.co/ghXx8nq8Dchttps://t.co/tiHgVcsidm",

    "full_text": "What should Fed monetary policy be in response to COVID-19, particularly if it becomes a global financial crisis?\n\nMostly summarizing/quoting this podcast episode: https://t.co/ZXkTFhof1p\n\nBuilding off this thread, which gives some historical context: https://t.co/byu4q3u2IBCOVID-19 was initially a supply shock (e.g supply chains)\n\nWhat markets are really worried about is a demand shock. \n\nThis negative supply shock is probably reducing expected growth in the global economy, and that's putting downward pressure on the equilibrium interest rateIf the Fed doesn't reduce interest rates along w/ a fall in the equilibrium rate, then monetary policy will get unintentionally tighter, &amp; that reduces aggregate demand\n\nIt's incorrect to say the Fed should just stand pat &amp; not adjust interest rates b/c it's a supply side problemAnd it's not correct to say that monetary policy can solve supply side problems either.\n\nThis supply side problem could then trigger a change in aggregate demand and monetary policy needs to adjust to prevent that secondary effect on aggregate demand. (e.g housing in 2008)The initial supply shock is similar to trade war last year.\n\nWhen there's a disruption to manufacturing supply chains, that tends to reduce business investment, which puts downward pressure on demand for credit, which (usually) reduces equilibrium interest rates.Also, w/ COVID, there's also a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. \n\nAnd when there's uncertainty, there's a rush for safe assets, people buy treasury bonds, that also puts downward pressure on interest rates. \n\nSo you have this downward pressure on global interest rates.You can think of the equilibrium rate as the rate consistent w/ stable economic growth &amp; consistent w/ the feds targets for inflation &amp; employment.\n\nIf the Fed sets its policy rate too high or too low, we go off track\n\nThis makes ppl think Fed should do nothing, but it's untrueDoing nothing is doing something\n\nIf you want money supply or interest rates to be the same as before, you have to do something to get it there\n\nif velocity slows, to maintain the same monetary policy, you have to increase money supply to offset effects on declining velocityB/c the dollar plays a large role in the global economy, changes in US monetary policy have ripple effects on other countries.\n\nIf Fed doesn't cut rates fast enough, monetary policy gets unintentionally tighter. Side effect of tighter money is the dollar appreciates in fx market.This also happened in the second half of 2008 during the financial crisis:\n\nThe dollar appreciated strongly, and for countries where their currencies are linked to the dollar &amp; that have borrowed a lot of money in dollars, this can become a very big burden.What should Fed do if it becomes a global financial crisis?\n\nTactics:\n\nIn 2008, the Fed extended a number of currency swap lines to a number of central banks across the world. Prob same again\n\nCutting interest rates, QE to address immediate crisis for liquidity, need for stimulusStrategy:\n\nGDP level targeting, but that's unrealistic, so instead level targeting of inflation. \n\nLevel targeting, as opposed to just inflation targeting, forces Fed to be much more serious.\n\nIf Fed overestimates inflation, they actually have to make up for past mistakesMany central banks have had excessively contractionary monetary policy, which has led to inflation &amp; growth not hitting their target.\n\nLow inflation &amp; low growth puts pressure on interest rates\n\nAs interest rates fall, ppl think central banks have easy monetary policy.Which is why people think there aren't many levers for monetary policy. But that's wrong. These low interest rates (&amp; QE) are really a reflection of previous tight money\n\nWe have to ask ourselves two questions:1/ what kind of target do we want for inflation or nominal GDP growth? \n\nThe higher the target, the higher the interest rate, &amp; the less QE you'll have to do, b/c ppl won't want to hold as much cash\n\nWant low inflation rate? (e.g. Japan, Switzerland) Do QE b/c ppl will hoard cash2/ Are we going to tell central banks to do whatever it takes to hit their inflation / growth targets?\n\nOr would we rather give this to fiscal policy?\n\nMonetary policy is less costly b/c it neither adds to our national debt nor puts a big tax burden on future generationsAlso less costly than fiscal policy b/c if the Fed buys a lot of assets, usually it will make a profit (they did in 2008)\n\nBut even if they make a modest loss, that loss is going to be a much smaller burden on future taxpayers than fiscal stimulus would beMaybe there's a chance that, if interest rates fell to zero and they couldn't be cut any further, they Fed could widen the range of assets (e.g. Treasury securities, corporate bonds) they could buy wide enough such that they'd have enough assets to hit a 2% inflation target.We keep seesawing but each time is better than before.\n\nOverreacted on expansionary side in 60s/70s\n\nIn last decade, overreacted on contractionary side\n\nBut 2008 was much better recovery than 1929.\n\nFed should be more responsive to market conditions than Phillips Curve modelsIn conclusion: Desired response is level targeting, ideally of GDP but inflation level targeting will do.\n\nAdditionally, Fed should cut interest rate target b/c I believe equilibrium interest rate has fallen, but cutting interest rates without level targeting isn't enough.",

They'll likely be happy to help you if you're doing well\n\n- Use gathered data to write specs for the role &amp; determine  criteriaWhat do execs need to be able to do:\n\n- Build organizations, often from scratch.\n\n- Also be primary individual contributors.\n\n- Act like an owner &amp; be a team playerUnderstand whether role is value protecting or value creating, and spec accordingly.\n\nCFO at SaaS company = value protection\n\nCFO at Opendoor = value creation\n\nValue protecting, hire for slope\n\nValue creation, hire for experience\n\nhttps://t.co/i8A4tXWvpKHire the best person for the next 9 months, not the next 3 yrs.\n\ni.e.:\n\nIf you find someone who's not good now but good 3 yrs from now, don't hire them. They won't or can't do what you need now\n\nIf you find someone who's good now but not in 3 yrs, hire them. You'll figure it out.Promote from within when you can.\n\nIt's how you keep great people who would otherwise leave for better opportunities elsewhere. It also shows there is upward mobility in the org.\n\nYou can trust them. They already know your culture and have team buy-in.Be careful hiring a big company executive for a startup. \n\nThe skill sets required for a big company exec vs a startup exec are very different. \n\nEven the best big company execs often don't know what to do once they arrive at a startup.If you know what you're doing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about 50/50. \n\nThat is, about 50% of the time you'll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person.\n\nIf you don't know what you're doing, it'll be way worse.Use an exec firm for sourcing, but don't outsource your evaluation, selling, or knowing what you need in the 1st place.\n\nNo one wants to pay $100K to a search firm, but a great exec hire pays back orders of magnitude more than that\n\nAvg time of search is 137 days, so start early!Q's to ask:\n\nIf you were CEO at your last co, what would you do differently? (You want them to be an owner).\n\nWhat's the business equation of your last company? (You want them to be strategic)\n\n\"Who are the people you'd bring along with you?\" (You want them to be a talent magnet)Best interviews are a mix of buying and selling.\n\nBuying - Asking Q's, digging in\n\nSelling - Painting a vision, expressing interest in specific candidate for a specific core part of that vision.\n\nQualify early: Why are they leaving? Why are they potentially interested in joining?On Compensation:\n\nBring it up in the beginning briefly to assure you're in the same ball park, and then don't bring it up again until the end when they're sold.\n\n\"If we're meant to work together, don't want comp to be the reason why we don't.\"After you hire them:\n\n- Manage your executives. Even if you're 20 and they're 70. (e.g. Weekly 1:1s)\n\n- But don't micro-manage (unless temporarily). If you feel urged to, it might mean you don't trust them. Dig into that.\n\n- Ask people under them semi-regularly how they're doing.When should you fire an executive\n\n- When you no longer trust them to build their org &amp; feel compelled to micro-manage.\n\n- Judged by output of their org. Are they hiring? training?\n\n- Andy Grove said you always fire a bad exec too late.

It becomes infinite, but only after infinite time\n\nWith hyperbolic growth, it can't keep growing forever, it becomes infinite at a definite time.As population growth became hyperbolic, we started to predict the timing of the singularity.\n\nBut every time we got close to it, popularity growth started to slow down. Makes sense.\n\nPopulation growth can't literally be infinite. So something has to give.\n\nhttps://t.co/YXYs05gAbiWe've had three phases of major demographic and technological growth when humanity was closing on\nthe singularity (early Bronze Age, early Iron age, early Renaissance)\n\nAnd two phases when it was either stagnant or moving away (middle &amp; late bronze age, black death) https://t.co/j6DDurlQNBTimes of population growth coincided with major tech revolutions (e.g. Bronze, Iron, Industrialization).\n\nTimes of stagnation coincide with hegemonic world orders (e.g. strong &amp; bureaucratic state, collectivism, corporatism\u2014sound familiar?)A sign of stagnation is that it there's a relative lack of new ideas to challenge the prevailing world order.\n\nStagnation also means everyone is competing for status since the pie isn't expanding.\n\nThere's some stability, but it's short-term. \n\nEventually individualism re-emergesSo the phase of population growth coincides with individualism &amp; rationalism, and the phase of decreased population coincides with collectivism &amp; mysticism\n\nThe latter is not a dark age, b/c there's stability &amp; gov't power, but it's not a Golden age either, b/c it's authoritarian https://t.co/9UsuWFOIqxThey have effective government like Golden Ages, but aren't creative like them. \n\nThey're stagnant like Dark Ages, but aren't chaotic like them. \n\nThey're a combination of Golden &amp; Dark Age\u2014A Brown Age.\n\nThere are 4 types of ages: Green, Yellow, Brown, Black.

You can only be for or against.Bad ideas are worse than bad people.\n\nNot that many bad people walking around, but lots of people get infected w/ bad ideas\n\nThey think they're doing good, or it might even be locally good, but globally bad, or it doesn't survive scaling.Why Pinker's optimism is premature:\n\nWe have a system in which more &amp; more of the kinetic energy (war) has been turned into potential energy (unused nuclear weapons). So if we don't take into account potential energy for destruction, then everything's getting better &amp; better.You talk about your taxpayer dollars supporting my physics habit, but what about my physics dollars supporting your lavish lifestyles?\n\nPhysics dollars led to development of semiconductor that won WWII, created the internet out of CERN. Do we get a licensing fee?Critique of Ayn Rand: \n\nShe was not sufficiently aware of the problems of multi level selection. Sometimes we act an individual level, but we can also act family level, group, level, national level.\n\nBut also her heroes were excellent, and I'm for genius instead of excellence.Excellence is consensus, quality control, 10,000 hrs\n\nExcellence is hill climbing, Genius is valley crossing\n\nWe want excellence in surgeons, Genius in inventors\n\nGenius is doing things that make almost no sense to others, &amp; can only be shown to have been sensible after the factSociety is run by power laws. \n\nThe thick tales of these distributions suggest that life isn't normally distributed, but distributed by power laws. \n\nAnd we need a special special class of people to play those tales to get us the returns to power us forward and advanced society.And so what I'm really interested in is not being blinded by excellence, to the prospects for other modalities in particular genius.\n\nSo you need the place for high agency people to go to high agency things with other high agency people in a very lightly regulated environment.\"To misbehave even. Like we're really going to regulate the hell out of Elon Musk, the one person who's working on the atomic layer. It's like, fine, maybe he's having too much fun w/ dating &amp; drugs, let him have fun w/ dating &amp; drugs. We need the cars &amp; batteries &amp; space travel\"We need some such a situation in which the the radical individual can say no to 10s of thousands or millions of ppl &amp; produce something of great value and beauty and grace for all of us or for themselves\n\nAnd any system that doesn't have that is not a system I want to be part ofOn overcoming imposter syndrome:\n\n\"I learned this from Jim Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. And he's he had this brilliant insight, which was, if you're going to do anything big, you are by definition unqualified to do it.\"Bad faith diversity:\n\n\"What do you do when you have a dinner party &amp; somebody says, Well, we didn't invite anyone from the suicide bombing community? Well, if you invite em, what you get is pink mist. Everyone's blown up, &amp; you didn't get a chance to hear the diversity of ideas\"\"I think I think of all the values out there of all the political issues out there, there's none more important free speech. \n\nBecause if if you believe in something, the only way I think that's legitimate to change other people's opinion, is by speaking to them\"And so as long as we accept reason as a standard, it's not 'Oh, you offended me' emotions are not part of the debate, or at least not as obstacles\n\nAnd if we eliminate free speech, if you can't have conversation, then truth is out the window. &amp; It's whatever the snowflakes decideExtreme identity politics tosses out reason &amp; conversation altogether:\n\nAcknowledge bias, but if it's a conversation stopper, then how exactly are we supposed to have a conversation?\n\nThat's why identity politics is toxic: if identity is paramount, communication is impossibleComedy is an art form that includes, among other things,  offending surgically exactly who needs to be offended &amp; with minimal collateral damage.\n\nA great comedian is like a sniper: They take out the hostage taker and they leave the hostage intact.We talk about critical thinking a lot, but critical feeling is really what we have to be cultivating as well\n\nCritical feeling: ensuring that your emotions are actually your own,&amp; that you're not simply reflecting what the emotions are of those around you to keep in good standingIt's keeping empathy in line with our analytics. It's knowing when we're being manipulated\n\nBe mindful of Russell Conjugation: I am steadfast, you are stubborn, he is a pig headed fool\n\nThe meaning is the same but the emotive shadings to the listener are different. Watch for thatOn education:\n\nThe sooner you get to the point where you're not being spoon fed something where the subject has been rearranged to make it maximally time expensive so that the teachers have jobs\n\nAlmost every subject can be rearranged so that it can be learned incredibly rapidly.Consider piano versus guitar: \"Piano, you learn all these scales, two styles, blah, blah, blah, nearly everybody learns to hate on the other hand guitar, like, very quickly, somebody shows you 3-4 chords, and you can play 95% of all the songs that ever meant something to you.\"\"I'm terrified that what's happened is that we've all fallen under a spell of magical thinking that it doesn't matter how bad things get it somehow the world is bizarrely stable &amp; safe and it absolutely isn't and I think maybe we need to actually activate the amygdala (continued)and remind everybody with what is hanging in the balance and how unstable this is so we can get on to the to the business of making a really beautiful planet for generations to come....\n\nThere's there's a sense that people are in a video game mode.\"\"Russian tradition on your wedding day, where you visit a memorial of those who gave their lives. Can you imagine? on the happiest day of your life, you pay homage to the people who died in Stalingrad?\"\n\n\"I'm not a fan of communism, but they have a better model of seriousness.I call it the no name revolution\u2014The n squared revolution which doesn't look like any revolution we've had before. It's much less physically violent. It's digitally extremely violent. &amp; it has to do w the fact that we can't make sense of things communally at a semi reliable levelEmbedded growth obligations: \n\nAs long as we had economic growth, you could promise people a future while having them contribute their youth into a system (e.g. academia).\n\nWhen that stopped, we had to make fake growth (financial engineering, printing money, etc)In order to keep running an institution that relies on growth, you start stealing from the future &amp; from groups too weak to defend their own interests.\n\nThat\u2019s why these institutions started lying\u2014to hide the fact that the growth is slowing, can't keep the ponzi going anymore.Perhaps this is also why our conversation has crumbled\n\nIf I can't find fulfillment in the outer world, I will look inside at what makes me special. &amp; we've all been taught that we're special by Barney. &amp; thus you saying anything that disagrees w/ me is taking away my specialnessAnd I worry that what we've done is created immunologically naive people who imagine that they are being assaulted and harmed by just about everything. And what I would love to do is to figure out how to get these indoor cats to grow some claws and get back the assault weaponsSocial media and polarization are overstated: \n\nif you look at the most polarized populations in the country, it's actually older people who are more polarized politically and are having fewer conversations with people on the other side of the aisle than younger people.You're the news that's fit to print, yet you avoid reporting a story that's counter narrative\u2014\n\nYour newspaper shouldn't have a strong narrative bc facts haven't come in yet\u2014\n\nWhy do you have a pre-planned narrative arc lasting 6 months, if you don't know what the truth is yet?",

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways from Samo Burja's \"Great Founder Theory\" &amp; other writings: Thread \ud83d\udc47\n\nGreat Founder Theory: https://t.co/THdfyDdeHg\n\nOther writing: https://t.co/UVMU3RkrDTDiff theories of history:\n\nGreat man theory looks at history through the lens of the individuals who shaped it.\n\nTechnological determinism explain events in terms of the technologies that enabled them.\n\nProgressivism looks at history through the lens of increasing social justice.Functional institutions are the exception, not the norm.\n\nSociety flourishes by having functional institutions\n\nGreat Founder Theory focuses on how great founders create (or rebuild) functional institutions that enable (sustained) flourishingA functional institution can outright solve a problem for a civilization. \n\nIt might, for example, complete the construction of infrastructure so important it changes the course of economic development for centuries to come, such as ancient China\u2019s grand canal or...solving COVID.\"Like many things, people\u2019s impact on the world follows a Pareto-like distribution, with the most impactful people having a far greater impact than the rest.\n\nThe creation of functional institutions is the means by which people are hugely impactful.\"It's easier to start from scratch than to rebuild from within.\n\nInstitutions often resist change, and diagnosing dysfunction is hard, as it usually has many causes\n\nThis explains Thiel\u2019s law: a founder\u2019s best shot at creating a functional institution is to get it from the start.Live &amp; Dead players:\n\nA live player is a person or a tightly coordinated group of people that is able to innovate (startup mentality).\n\nA dead player is a person or a group of people that is working off a script, incapable of doing new things. (incumbent mentality)Understanding a player is dead means you can replace them without much of a fight.\n\nUnderstanding a player is live means you can collaborate with them and you should be mindful of their path to power\n\nTo revive a dead player, you have to displace an existing power structureWhat happens to institution when great founder dies?\n\nSuccession challenge.\n\nPower succession: Who takes over\n\nSkill succession: How do they gain the skills.\n\nRome solved this by \"adopting\" someone early and ensuring their trainingIf the succession problem is unsolved, the only process of institutional reform is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as creative destruction.\n\nThat we praise this process indicates we've resigned ourselves to failed succession.We should temper our enthusiasm for intense political and economic competition and instead develop a greater appreciation for the importance of successful succession. \n\nThis change would go far in remedying contemporary institutional sclerosis and stagnation.The purpose of a bureaucracy is to save the time of a competent person.\n\nPut another way: to save time, some competent people will create a system that is meant to do exactly what they want \u2014 nothing more and nothing lessCreate a bureaucracy when you are both \n\n(a) trying to do something that you do not have the capacity to do on your own, and \n\n(b) unable to find a competent, aligned person to handle the project for you. \n\nBureaucracies ameliorate the problem of talent and alignment scarcity.Bureaucrats are expected to act according to a script, or a set of procedures \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\n\nOwners don\u2019t trust that bureaucrats will be competent or aligned enough to act in line with the owner\u2019s wishes of their own accord.\n\nIf low trust, minimize downside (&amp; thus cap upside)Other methods of accomplishing goals:\n\nIf you have access to a delegate (i.e someone you trust), don\u2019t treat them like a bureaucrat. \n\nA delegate can perform tasks you didn\u2019t know needed doing and build aligned systems beyond your design, a bureaucrat cannot.Status is a coordination mechanism\u2014the relative respect &amp; patterns of deference accorded to people, groups &amp; organizations by wider society.\n\nDispersing it wisely decreases friction for certain high impact people to team up and work on certain high impact projects (&amp; vice versa).Celebration of such people isn\u2019t merely a personal reward. \n\nIt is how we replenish this social capital, which in turn powers the social fabric that enables these people to do what they do. \n\nWithout it, you can\u2019t go to space. (e.g. Elon helping make space cool &amp; feasible)Dispersing status is one of the most important roles of the ruler\u2014\n\nThe ruler uses his prestige to regulate overall status, so that the right people &amp; the right behaviors win, solving coordination problems &amp; tragedies of the commons.\n\nGlory is a better motivator than money.intellectual dark matter: knowledge we cannot see publicly, but whose existence we can infer because our institutions would fly apart if the knowledge we see were all there was.\n\nThe danger of copying:\n\nOnce a tradition is lost, you are making photocopies of photocopies.Each subsequent copy loses information. \n\nA crucial difference between organisms &amp; organizations is that organizations do not undergo natural selection. \n\nSince the fidelity of transmitting intricate social technologies is so low, complex adaptations cannot arise.Lost knowledge: Just as physicists are only able to observe 15% of matter in existence, today we possess written fragments from only 13% of the ~2,000 known ancient Greek \n\nMuch of our foundational knowledge was built on that ~13% Imagine how much we'd have if we'd found more?Tacit knowledge is knowledge that's not transmitted in writing. \n\ne.g. a blacksmith learns to craft well-balanced swords through direct practice and correction from a master \u2014 not by reading a textbook.\n\nMy 4/1 assist to turnover ratio in pick up b-ball\u2014you can't teach that.YouTube enables the teaching of tacit knowledge at scale unlike anything before.\n\nWithout YT, much tactic knowledge turned into intellectual dark matter.\n\nYT searches in the \u201chow-to\u201d category have grown 70% year-on-year.\n\nPerhaps as influential as printing press or telegraph.Samo's YouTube content is also great: https://t.co/7JhnlXVc9h\n\nDid a couple podcasts w/ him:\n\nhttps://t.co/8VDZeY9kg3\n\nhttps://t.co/eFR7SL4Pwg",

Adler says choose our lives &amp; our lifestyles\"Freud\u2019s idea is that a person\u2019s psychic wounds (traumas) cause their present unhappiness. \n\nWhen you treat a person\u2019s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality &amp; sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive.But Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: \u201cNo matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.\u201d That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.\"He isn't saying that the experience of a calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong.\n\nBut he's saying we can determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences\"If I stay in my room all the time, without ever going out, I can get all of my parents\u2019 special attention focused on me. \n\nOn the other hand, if I take even one step out of the house, I\u2019ll just become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. No longer special.\"To quote Adler: \u201cThe important thing is not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.\u201d \n\nYou want to be Y or someone else because you are utterly focused on what you were born with. \n\nInstead, you\u2019ve got to focus on what you can make of your equipment.A person wants to be a novelist, but never seems to complete his work. \n\nHe wants to leave the possibility of \u201cI can do it if I try\u201d open, by not committing to anything. \n\nIf he tried and failed, he'd shut the door to that. Many things are like this: invented stories to never tryAll problems stem from interpersonal relationships; (all joys stem from interpersonal relationship.)\n\nIf you can just be by yourself, you\u2019ll even have a justification ready whenever other people snub you.\n\nThat if you didn't have your shortcomings, you too could be loved.Anger is a form of communication, and communication is possible without using anger. \n\nWe can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for anger. \n\nIf you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all on its own.Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. \n\nIt leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise me, I won\u2019t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I\u2019ll engage in inappropriate actions, too.\u201cFreedom is being disliked by other people.\u201d \n\nThe courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. \n\n(Don't be a jerk but:) \u201cYou have enemies? Good. It means you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d - Churchill\"My father was a moody person. But to blame him for why our relationship went bad is Freudian etiology.\n\nThe Adlerian teleology reverses the cause-and-effect interpretation.\n\ne.g. I brought out the memory of his badness b/c I don\u2019t want my relationship w/ my father to get better\"\"That\u2019s right. For me, it was more convenient to not repair my relationship with my father. I could use having a father like that as an excuse for why my own life wasn\u2019t going well. That for me was a virtue. And there was also the aspect of taking revenge on a feudal father.\"Should strive for, in order:\n\n1. self acceptance\n\n2. confidence in others\n\n3. contribution to others\n\n\u201cPeople are my comrades, the world is a beautiful place.\u201dOut of ten people, two will love you, one will dislike you, and seven won't pay attention to you. \n\nFocus on the two that love you, not the ones that dislike you or the seven who don't care.When one adopts the POV of Freud, one sees life as a great big story based on cause and effect. \n\nSo it's all about where and when I was born, what my childhood was like, the school I attended and the company where I got a job. \n\nThat decides who I am now and who I will become.For Adler, You're not bound by the past. Life isn't a linear narrative. \n\nLife isn't like climbing a mountain. You are not \"en route\". \n\nIt's more like a series of dots/moments. \"Here and now\"\n\nLive like you're dancing: you're enjoying the moment but also going somewhere.As long as you don\u2019t lose sight of guiding star of \u2018I contribute to others\u2019 you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like.\n\nWhether you\u2019re disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free, but don\u2019t care what people say about you\"The greatest life lie is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past and future, cast a dim light on one's entire life, and believe that one has been able to see something.\"\n\n**\n\nWould love to hear any well-reasoned critiques",

More insight into Peter's thoughts here:https://t.co/SDM2SYVsK8We're no longer moving faster.\n\nThe acceleration of travel speeds\u2014from faster sailing ships in the 16th through 18th centuries, to the advent of faster railroads in the 19th century, and still-faster cars and airplanes in the 20th century\u2014reversed in 2003 w/ the Concorde failure.The official explanation for the slowdown in travel centers on the high cost of fuel, which points to the much larger failure in energy innovation. \n\nNixon\u2019s 1974 call for full energy independence by 1980 has given way to Obama\u2019s 2011 call for one-third oil independence by 2020.If you think about where oil prices were in 1973 - it was $2 a barrel - in 2012 it was $100 a barrel. \n\nAnd so you\u2019ve had a failure of energy innovation, &amp; it\u2019s basically been offset by computer innovation\u2014That\u2019s a simplified account of what\u2019s happened in the last 40 years.When thinking about stalled growth...\n\nTo a 1st approximation, the progress in computers &amp; failure in energy appear to have roughly canceled each other out\n\nLike Alice in the Red Queen\u2019s race, we (&amp; our computers) have been forced to run faster &amp; faster to stay in the same placeLife expectancy isn't rising as fast as it used to.\n\nWe see fewer blockbuster drugs in the pipeline\u2014perhaps because of the intransigence of the FDA, perhaps because of the fecklessness of today\u2019s biological scientists, &amp; perhaps because of all the complexity of human biology.In 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first person on the moon.\n\nWe haven't been back to the moon since 1972 and with the final Shuttle flight in 2011, the US will be without the ability to send an astronaut into orbit for the first time since it began its manned space program.The 1969 version was: we landed on the moon in July of 1969 and Woodstock starts three weeks later. And maybe that's one way you could describe the cultural shift.There is a Marxist theory that the time for Communism would come when interest rates went to zero because the zero percent interest rate was a sign that capitalists no longer had any idea what to do with their money, &amp; thus they should redistribute the capital\n\nWe're out of ideasWe live in a world where we've been working on the Star Trek computer in Silicon Valley, but we don't have anything else from Star Trek.\n\nWe don't have the warp drive, we don't have the transporter, we can't re-engineer matter in this cornucopian world where there is no scarcity.In the 50s and 60s, technology meant atoms in addition to bits. \n\nIt meant biotech, medical devices. It meant nuclear power, new forms of energy, underwater cities, the green revolution in agriculture, space travel, supersonic aviation, flying cars, etc.Consider the classic versions of science fiction cities: underwater, cities on the moon, cities on Mars cities in outer space.\n\nRadically different and very definite ideas of the future, that would become self-fulfilling prophecies of one sort or another.\n\nThese views look dated.Name one sci-fi film in the last 25 years in which tech is portrayed in a positive light, in which it\u2019s not dystopian, it doesn\u2019t kill people, it doesn\u2019t destroy the world, etc. \n\nInstead, we have one sort of catastrophic, anti-technological scenario after anotherThe future of the computer in 1969 was centralization, large governments, large companies. \n\nFast-forward to 1999. The future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. Libertarian utopia.\n\nFast-forward to 2019. The status quo has swung back to 1969.The era of globalization improved living standards by making labor and goods cheaper, but also hurt living standards through increased competition for limited resources. Free-trade advocates tend to think that the first effect dominates the second.When you talk about AI as the last computing device where you\u2019re building a mind that can outthink &amp; outwit any human being, you end up with these very scary &amp; political questions: Is it going to be friendly? Is it dangerous? \n\nNot, what is this going to do to unemployment?The Google propaganda is that we have runaway technological progress many people will be left behind, and we need to take care of them. \n\nThis doesn't show up in any of the data. We have 3.5% unemployment and the productivity numbers are still anemic.The data point people always give is self-driving cars. \n\nEven if you got them, it might replace at most 1 percent of the workforce, it might increase productivity by a few percent in the economy. \n\nIf you phased them in over a decade, it would not be that transformative.We've actually had *less* automation. \n\nkindergarten teachers, nurses, yoga instructors, all these sort of nontradeable service sector jobs are fairly immune to automation.If we had this sort of runaway automation, you could get to 3%, 4% GDP growth, and at 3% to 4% GDP growth, we can solve these problems socially.\n\nThen there will be a lot more room for various social programs\n\nIf automation's happening, then we'll see in the productivity numbersAnd, given sufficient automation, then eventually maybe we need something like UBI. If automation is not happening and you do UBI, then you just blow up the economy. \n\nEven a Marxist thinks you have to first get the capitalists to do things before you can redistribute stuff.We\u2019re not allowed to develop new drugs with the FDA charging $1.3 billion per new drug. \n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to fly supersonic jets because they\u2019re too noisy. \n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to build nuclear power plants.\n\nWe've outlawed the world of atoms, so ppl focus on bits.If you give me a choice of getting rid of the vast bulk of government regulations &amp; keeping the Fed, I\u2019d much rather do that than keeping all the other zoning laws &amp; crazy rules we have and going with PayPal, Bitcoin, gold, any sort of alternate currency one could come up with.Why did brilliant people in the Soviet Union become grandmaster chess players? They weren\u2019t allowed to do anything else.\n\n\nSame with why so many brilliant rocket scientists went into wall street, because they couldn't use their skills due to overregulation.It\u2019s hard to remember this, but gov't was once high tech, too: The Apollo program put a man on the moon.  \n\nBut today our government is broken. Our newest fighter jets can\u2019t even fly in the rain.\n\nThat is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan project.Science has gotten dramatically worse, by being a victim of its own success.\n\nWe poured money on it, which politicized the system. But a great scientist is the opposite of a good politician. A scientist is someone who pursues truth. A politician manipulates truth. So we miss out.A lot of innovators discovered things, but weren\u2019t able to get anything. \n\nTesla was out-competed by Edison, even though Edison had an inferior technology. \n\nThe Wright brothers came up with the first airplane, but they didn\u2019t get to be rich.\n\nEinstein discovered relativity--nadaWhen were the last political speeches you can remember where people in very concrete terms portrayed a future that looks very different from the present? \n\nGorbachev: \u201cTear down that wall\"\n\nWe've gotten more vague: \"Hope and Change\"\n\nIt didn't do well. People are scared of changeThe 1990s narrative was the new economy, and they lied about growth.\n\nAnd then the 2000s narrative was the Great Moderation, and they lied about volatility.\n\nAnd maybe the 2010s one is secular stagnation, where they lie about the real interest rates, b/c the other two don't work.Why the slowdown?\n\nIs it an external reality that\u2019s made it hard or is it something in the culture that\u2019s changed that makes us less ambitious?\n\nCulture. We\u2019re often too biased to go to the natural explanation b/c it\u2019s one that exonerates us from responsibility for the slowdownExtreme optimism &amp; extreme pessimism are both equally wrong. \n\nWe should always come back to the question of individual agency and it's not these large historic forces. \n\nThere's always room for history, for new ideas, and these things are never definitively decided either way.Think a lot harder about the future...try to think concretely what you want to do...there's always a question, where is the frontier, where are some pockets of innovation where you can do some new things and not be in a crazed competition.\n\n3 possible technological frontiers:Cyberspace:  The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. \n\nThe limitation of the Internet is that these new worlds are virtual and that any escape may be more imaginary than real. \n\nStill TBD.Outer space: Because the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics. \n\nBut we are still ways away from being ready for this.Seasteading: Between cyberspace &amp; outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans. \n\nThe tech involved is more tentative than the Internet, but more realistic than space travel. \n\nWe may have reached the stage at which it will soon be economically feasible.",

School diversity, just like restaurants.\n\nSome of them would concentrate on arts, others on sciences, others on vocational activities\n\nschools of every variety appealing to every taste to serve every need, the best ones rising to the topYou'd think political coalitions would be bottom 51% vs. the top 49%, but that actually doesn't make much sense.\n\nThose at the bottom economically tend to be less skillful politically, so the coalition ends up being upper middle class and lower middle class vs the top and bottomWhat about 100% inheritance tax?\n\nThat encourages people to spend as much as possible, but what about future investment?\n\nThe amazing thing is is the extent to which the market system has encouraged people to work hard and sacrifice for their children.Social Security is also sold as a program to benefit the poor. \n\nBut Social Security is a program which imposes unduly heavy taxes on lower income groups in the society to provide higher benefit to upper income groups in the society, because they live longer and get to enjoy it.Great Depression was a failure of gov\u2019t via monetary policy, not private business.\n\nDuring 1929-1933, total quality of money declined by 1/3.\n\nWhy are gov\u2019t so popular even when it doesn\u2019t work?\n\nMarket has no press agents. Gov't has great many press agents.The goal is to create a system where it is politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right things instead of politically profitable for the right people to do the wrong thingsBefore 1914 mass immigration was easier \u2014 became difficult once we implemented the welfare state, can't afford it infinitely.despite all the rhetoric about the minimum wage helping the poor, the unions were in favor of a higher minimum wage for a very different reason, because it would protect the members of their unions from competition from the lower and lesser skilled people.In the first place, all of these programs involve some people spending other people's money for objectives that are determined by still a third group of people.\n\nNobody spend somebody else's money as carefully as the person who spends their own.Someone once said, there are no problems in NYC that couldn't be solved if the city budget was twice what it is now.\n\nCity budget has tripled and many projects are worse. When gov't has more money, citizens have less to spend. Citizens spend $ more carefully than gov'ts do on avg\"Why is housing so bad in NYC? Bad governmental policy.\n\nIf you have eliminated the government from the housing market, and left that money in the hands of the people themselves, the housing situation in the US today would be far better than it is.\"We are expected to conclude that the rich are responsible for the deprivation of the poor.\n\nThey are rich at the expense of the poor.\n\nBut the truth is that\u2019s not what happens .\n\nThere has never been a more effective machine for eliminating poverty than free markets.Life is unfair. \n\nThere's nothing fair about one men being born blind and another man being born with sight. \n\nThere's nothing fair about one man being born of a wealthy parent and one of a poor parent.\n\nThere's nothing fair about Lebron being able to dunk and you can't.Classic MF: \"I am a liberal, I believe in freedom liberalism means of and belonging to freedom pertaining to freedom. Those people who now call themselves liberals have misappropriated the term because for them it simply means that they are liberal with other people's money.\"We talk about market failures, but those happen occasionally. Whereas the same market failures (i.e negative externalities &amp; principle-agent problems) are built into most gov't actions \n\nWhich makes the cure often worse than the disease.Government protects its workers, just as trade unions protect their members, but both do it at someone else's expense.\n\nWhen unions get higher wages for their members by restricting entry into an occupation, those higher wages are at the expense of other workers.When government pays its employees higher wages, those higher wages are at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nBut when when employees get higher wages through the competition of the free market, those higher wages are at nobody's expense, and are often at other's benefit. Bigger pie.Invisible hand in economics: People intend to serve private interest but actually also serve public interests.\n\nInvisible hand in politics: People intend to serve public interests but actually end up serving private interests.\"Mr Friedman what policies would lead to adequate housing for all the poor?\n\n\"Well, What we now consider inadequate, would have been considered a palace 150 years ago. Avg income of the poor is higher than avg income of all the people in USSR.\"So you have to ask a very different kind of question:\n\nWhat system will give the widest range of people the greatest opportunity to make the most out of themselves?

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways &amp; quotes from Keith Rabois interviews \ud83d\udc47:I think most ppl who succeed at changing the world have extreme talent in at least 1-2 dimensions. They also might have a screw loose in at least 1-2 dimensions.\n\nThe ones that thrive are self-aware enough to know where their screws are loose, &amp; seek a compliment to solve for it.If you\u2019re going to succeed as a startup, you need to be able to find and hire undiscovered talent. \n\nYou cannot recruit people who are proven.\n\nWhy? There will always be large incumbents outbidding you when trying to hire known talented individuals\n\nhttps://t.co/yuyx5Sogd3Quoting Vinod Khosla: \u201cThe team you build is the company you build\u201d\n\nQuoting Patrick Collison: \u201cThe reason why the first 10 employees are the most important is every one of those 10 employees is going to replicate him or herself 10 times.Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for.When attempting to hire unrecognized potential, you'll inherently make mistakes (if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re too conservative)\n\nDon\u2019t try to be a \u201czero-defect hirer.\u201d\n\nThe false-negative hires (the ppl you didn\u2019t hire that could have been great) are more of a mistake than the bad hiresWhen you need upside, hire aptitude. When protecting against the downside, hire experience.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to create something from scratch, experience is often a handicap\u201dDouble down on your stars:\n\nIf you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is way more important than trying to fix ppl who will never create 10x value. \n\nManagement drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employees.What to do w/ struggling employees?\n\nMost managers in baseball usually make the mistake of leaving in their starting pitcher too long, as opposed to calling for the relief pitcher\n\nThe starter got you so far, but you need a different skill set to go forward.How to identify stars? \n\nNotice who people in the company go to talk to that they don\u2019t have to (watch whose desk becomes popular \u2013 this is especially noticeable in an open office).\n\nThat's how you discover the problem solvers\u201cConstantly expand the scope of responsibility for every single employee. Everybody will break at some point, but you want to keep pushing the envelope until they can\u2019t discharge that level of responsibly successfully anymore.\u201dBenefits of small teams:\n\n- People have an ownership mentality\n- You can see who\u2019s doing well\n- It\u2019s easier to spot the existing skill gaps\n- People have a sense of independence\n- A narrower focus/scope results, this improving executionUp until 20-50 employees, manage \"through osmosis.\"\n\nAfter that, weekly-wide company meeting, weekly 1on1s w/ 5-7 direct reports (direct report set agenda)\n\nEveryone should understand the company\u2019s priorities, business equation, biggest risks and plans to solve for them.In a startup, domain expertise isn\u2019t all that important\n\nExperts tend to know what you can\u2019t do very well. They don\u2019t ask enough why questions; \u2018Why can\u2019t this be done this way? I like people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re tackling, but they\u2019re fast learners.For investments: \n\n\"I tend to like things that are super ambitious, that are almost ridiculous. Just how ridiculous? \n\nI want half of my VC friends to laugh at an investment I make. If half don\u2019t laugh, it means I\u2019m not taking enough risk, and the project isn\u2019t ambitious enough.\"Criteria for founders: Magnet for Talent.\n\nHow to test?\n\nCall former colleagues of the founder, and ask them if they would join (or invest in) the founder\u2019s current company, and why/why notOn Total Available Market (TAM) Analyses:\n\nThe real issue with a small TAM is not that the market isn't big enough, it's that the value prop isn't compelling enough. If you make it more compelling, you'll capture more value.Startups have roughly the same amount of pain to go from 0 to 1, regardless of whether 1 is a $100 billion company or $100 million company, so you might as well do something important because the pain\u2019s going to be the same. You might as well get the outcome that offsets the painHow to be strategic? Understand the business equation.\n\n\"Every business, when it works, is like an equation \u2013 X times Y times Z with some weighting. Understanding that equation in your brain, and being able to manipulate the variables, is the key to being strategic.\u201dPeople w/ good strategy know what knobs they have at their disposal, which they can turn and how they affect each other. If you know one knob can only be turned up to 7, they don\u2019t try to turn it to 8, they say \u201cmaybe we can turn this other knob up and it\u2019s more likely to work\u201d.Margins don\u2019t matter as much as you think, but cash flow does:\n\nImagine you have a business that kicks off at 10% margins, but it grows to be 10% of everything on the planet \u2013 that\u2019s a big business\u201cIf your tech is better, but potential customers are too set in their ways to switch, use it yourself and compete with them\u201d \n\n\"If you\u2019re a company who\u2019s better at reducing fraud, you don\u2019t want to sell that as service to somebody else, you want to build the full stack yourselfBeing a component in someone else\u2019s stack doesn\u2019t usually end well\n\nThere\u2019s the adoption risk issue (long sales cycles etc.)\n\nThere\u2019s economic issues \u2013 you\u2019re only capturing 10-30% of the value you create, if you\u2019re selling to someone else, depending on how good you are at sales)As an example, if you have a differentiated advantage (say in chip design or battery life) you want to ship the end product to the customer yourself (and not sell your batteries to someone like Apple) \u2013 this way you get more credit for what you\u2019re asymmetrically good at.Lesson learned from Pat Riley's Winner Within:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the best at what you do, you want to be the only one who does what you do\u201d\n\nYou often have to narrow the scope of what you do to accomplish that.Keith\u2019s Superpowers:\n\n1/ Being able to spot 19-28-year-old people with talent, who have yet to be discovered or experience success, and project their future potential (and then go on to mentor or invest in them)\n\n2/ Blending design thinking w/ empirical analysis.On deciding btwn founding v. join:\n\nFind path w/ steepest slope. Something that makes you nervous/uncomfortable. If not, you\u2019re not maximizing growth\n\nSome learn best thrown into the deep end, try to swim (founding). Others learn best by watching first (joining)\n\nKnow your style.Once someone gets older, there\u2019s enough data points on their resume where many people could evaluate their background and come to the same conclusion; their potential and abilities are well-defined.What you want to do is find someone that doesn\u2019t have enough data points, and instead you have to try to project potential and how they may translate to a certain profession without knowing with certainty.For example, a CS student from Stanford is incredibly overrated in terms of demand for their talent versus what they can actually do on average. You have plenty of people throwing money at them. They don\u2019t always develop the best work ethic because of that. They're entitled.What you want to find are people that other people aren\u2019t chasing after but they have even more talent &amp; grit. That\u2019s doable, but hard. It\u2019s a little bit like drafting athletes in various sports. You're trying to find Tom Brady in the 6th round.What to look for in a co-founder? \n\n#1 Someone who can help you solve core risks to the biz. Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles (data vs design driven culture, closed vs open ecosystem, similar instincts on ppl).Is VC more like baseball or basketball:\n\nBasketball: Team cohesion crucial, 1 Lebron can dominate, but can't have 3 bc not enough ball to go around\n\nBaseball: Mostly collection of individuals &amp; clear accountability, can have many heavy hitters, 1 Lebron isn't as dominantDecision making framework:\n\nDon\u2019t make a list of pros and cons; that\u2019s not a great way to make these kind of decisions.\n\nFigure out your number one priority, and optimize on that dimension.Ben Franklin had this great quote which I\u2019ve always used as a guide for my own decision-making and career. It\u2019s, \u201cTwo ways to be successful in life: do something worth writing about or write something worth reading.\u201dFavorite interview question:\n\nWhat do you want to do with your life? That\u2019s usually my first question. Sometimes it catches people off-guard, but it allows you to quickly understand who they are, what they care about, and calibrate your feedback.If you\u2019re going to attract people with extremely high potential, the first thing you have to do is let them thrive. \n\nYou have to give them the degrees of freedom to do both what they can do very well, and to some extent, allow them to make mistakes.If you try to constrain really talented people, you\u2019re only going to create a mirror of yourself with your same strengths and weaknesses. \n\nYou HAVE to let people do stuff that you disagree with. You can\u2019t tell how good they are if they\u2019re just replicating what you\u2019d have them doManage People on Inputs, Not Outputs\n\nOtherwise nobody on your team will take on the more difficult tasks.\n\nSo, to incentivize employees to complete ambitious tasks, gauge the quality of their work based on how it effective it was at getting you towards an ambitious goal.On why anti-lean startup:\n\nThe best metaphor for creating a startup is like producing a movie\n\nSomeone has a vision for a movie, writes a script, casts it, finances the production, markets the film with a trailer, and then distributes it (and hopefully people come to see it)Thiel used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. \n\nAnd we all rebelled, b/c it's so unnatural, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing.Calendar audit: when I work with CEOs, I ask them to specify their priorities they are, pie-chart style, and then pull out their calendar and see if it matches.\n\nIt never does. Recruiting is the big thing that doesn't align.\u201cThe whole fake news debate is ridiculous. The average American today is by any metric, more informed than the average American any time in history.\u201d\n\nTyler Cowen has said \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say about Facebook that isn\u2019t true of the printing press\u201dDefinition of Professional Success:\n\nThe number of undiscovered talented ppl he\u2019s able to mentor that turn out to make meaningful impact in the world.\n\nThe number of companies he\u2019s able to help or influence, in one way or another, that end up going on to transform the world.",

Do 20-50 meetings in 2-3 weeks all back-to-back. Be 100% focused on raising.Good ways to get investor referrals:\n\na) introductions from other founders or strong deal sources\nb) introductions from existing investors\n\nBad ways to get investor referrals:\na) introduction from investors who aren\u2019t investing \nb) cold outreachUnderstand the VC biz model:\n\n\"Out of ten swings at the bat, you get maybe seven strikeouts, two base hits, and if you are lucky, one home run. The base hits and the home runs pay for all the strikeouts.\"\"So logically their investment selection strategy requires a credible\u00a0potential\u00a0of a 10x gain within 4 to 6 years on any individual investment\u2014so that the winners will pay for the losers &amp; in the timeframe\u00a0their\u00a0LPs expect.\"\n\nIf you don't want to 10x in 4-6 yrs, don't raise VC!Parallel track angels &amp; VCs simultaneously.\n\nTell angels if you want that you can secure their allocation if they commit early (or it's more likely), \n\nAsk VCs at the end exactly how their process works.Do your research on the firms &amp; angels. See what else they've invested in.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand their fund size, deal cadence, talk to their founders, you\u2019re not taking it seriously enough.\n\nYou are one of dozens of meetings for them a week. Stand out by doing your homework.During the meeting, don't read your deck to investors. Make it a conversation.\n\nIn the beginning perhaps ask \"Have you invested in the space before?\" to gauge their knowledge.\n\nMidway through the pitch ask \"What's interesting to you about this biz? What's unclear?\"When pitching:\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to consider the biggest reasons an investor might *not* invest, and pre-emptively address those reasons.\n\nIf you\u2019ve solved for them, point to evidence.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, point to how you\u2019ll address them, and the moat you\u2019ve built to date.Ask in the beginning:\n\n\"Do you believe there will be a multi-billion dollar co in the space?\"\n\nIf no \u2014&gt; don\u2019t go further until yes\n\nIf yes \u2014&gt; here's our unfair advantage and why now (instead of 5 yrs ago or 5 yrs from now)When fundraising for a complex co, you might simplify it for investors by saying something like:\n\n\"In order to invest, you'd have to believe that we can execute on X, so that we have Y, which will lead to a multi-billion $ biz.\"\n\nFrame it simply so they can pitch their partners.A founder told me it was reasonable to him that the conversation break down in an founder-to-investor pitch would be 90% founder, 10% investor.\n\nIMO it should be closer to 50/50. The more they talk and ask Qs, the closer they are to getting to a yes.Unconfident fundraisers talk 90% of the time, hammer home hand-wavy talking points, &amp; grasp at straws for what they think VCs wanna hear.\n\nConfident fundraisers listen 50% of the time, ask questions, &amp; admit the risks to investing as well as what they have &amp; haven't proven yet.After pitching, one thing you may try \u2014 under the context of your improvement \u2014 is asking them to role play as if they were pitching your biz to their partnership.\n\nIf they don\u2019t pitch it well, that may tell you something. Conversely, you may like their phrasing better.VCs will say nice things but It's always a no until it's a yes\n\nMost likely nearly all investors will say no but you only need one or a few to say yes.\n\nYou're going to feel like a total failure at it until someone says yes and then you feel like a huge success.You have to maintain a sort of dual awareness: the confidence of someone who's going to raise easily alongside the paranoia of someone who won't (so that you'll prepare like mad)\n\nhttps://t.co/jwjrR1A5rIEvery pitch meeting in which you don't consider updating a slide in your deck is a missed opportunity to learn.\n\nhttps://t.co/7315mSEMkJOther things to think about:\n\nMoney should last to 18-24 months and enable you to reach meaningful milestones\n\nSeed rounds typically result in 15-25% dilution for founders. \n\nKnow whether existing investors are following-on, and how much of the round is already spoken for.Don't recommend setting price at the beginning.\n\n\"We want to work with the best people, so don't want price to be the reason why that wouldn't happen\"\n\n\"We're gonna let the market set the price, but it'll be something reasonable, but ultimately we want to pick the best partner.\"Question to have an answer for:\n\nIf this failed, why? (related to biggest risks)\n\nYou may want to ask the investor that too:\n\nhttps://t.co/ZRyV06cmSf",

    "full_text": "Peter Zeihan is one of the most important thinkers in geopolitics today.\n\nHere are my high level takeaways from his latest book, Disunited Nations, &amp; his recent interviews.\n\nTLDR: US created global order after WWII. US backing out b/c no longer makes sense. Chaos ensues.His books:\n\nAccidental Superpower recounts why U.S. created the global order the way they did &amp; why they are leaving\n\nAbsent Superpower explains the shale revolution &amp; how it accelerates U.S. retreat\n\nDisunited Nations examines who will flourish &amp; struggle in the new (dis)orderThere have been four ages:\n\nImperial: You didn't trade for things. You stole them. (Britain pre U.S.)\n\nPost WW2: U.S. sacrificed economics for security to fight the Russians\n\n3rd Age: U.S. forgot about the sacrifice after cold war\n\n4th age: U.S. woke up\n\nhttps://t.co/vRMc64S81vBush HW had best grasp on foreign policy, but was voted out.\n\nClinton focused domestically.\n\nBush W was distracted by 9/11.\n\nObama got it intellectually, but didn't do much.\n\nFor 30 yrs, we had no coherent foreign policy vision.\n\nAnd now Trump is taking sledgehammer to the order.Post WWII, U.S. effectively said:\n\n\"You don't have to worry about wars or invasions or supply routes or food or energy or anything. The global system will take care of it, the US will subsidize and protect the global system.\"\n\nThis won't be true anymore. They're on their own now.This means that countries that depended on the global order will be screwed: China. Germany. Russia. Iran.\n\nThis means that countries that flourished w/o the global order will flourish: Japan. France. Argentina. Turkey.\n\nU.S. is in best position b/c it was least dependent of allWhat you need to thrive without the global order: \n\n- Perfect geography (mountains good, but oceans better, &amp;  crunchy exterior so ppl can't get to you)\n- Can supply your own food and energy\n- Sustainable population structure\n- Sufficient military resources to protect oneselfThese four countries are odd contenders in some ways:\n\nArgentina: Special case when it comes to national dsyfunction.\n\nTurkey: been out of commission for a century\n\nFrance: Used to be a major power but Germany best them in a global order world.\n\nJapan: U.S. nuked them twiceU.S. in the best position of them all:\n\n- Shale revolution = U.S. energy independent.\n- Only 8% of GDP came from international exchange, so already independent\n- Most balanced population structure\n- Geography: not only is the richest chunk of territory, , it is the most secure.Demographics can be broken into 4 groups:\n\n- Children \n- Young Adults (millennials are holding down the fort when it comes to consumption, at least in U.S)\n- Mature Adults (they work &amp; pay taxes)\n- Retirees (they spend)\n\nIt's important to have balanced ratios between these 4Japan:\n\n- Strong navy\n- Good geography for their military\n- Expert in de-sourcing \"build where you sell\"\n- It has the capacity to go out and take everything that it needs or interface with friendly countries in order to get what it wants.Turkey:\n\n- Largest army in NATO outside of the United States\n- Recent skirmishes make it \"battle tested\"\n- No one who can really hold a candle to it within its own neighborhood.France is the only significant European country that can take care of itself once the United States leaves \n\n- Stable population structure\n- Didn't internationalize manufacturing\n- Doesn't need global market to sell to\n- Doesn't have security concerns Germany hasArgentina:\n\n- Has absolutely everything it needs within its own borders\n- Faces no security threats\n- Has natural resources the rest of world needs (energy, raw materials, food)\n- Good demographics\n- Great geographyWhy can't another country pick up where US left off?\n\n- Germany doesn't have military strength\n- China can't reach beyond the first island chain\n- French are regionally obsessed \n- Japanese don't want to go beyond Pacific\n- British are out of practiceChina is in tough place:\n\n- One child policy led to not enough consumers &amp; workers, &amp; too many retirees\n- Import 85% of their energy, that goes away\n- They can't maintain their food output \n- Low naval capacity\n- Credit &amp; debt bubble\n- Can't keep up food production w/o importsMany ways China can implode in next 10 yrs. E.g:\n\n- Lack of consumers &amp; aging work-force\n- Energy crisis in Middle East\n- Export industry collapses\n\nEvery pillar that China has used to base their entire civilization on is beyond their control, &amp; it's all cracking at the same timeGermany also in tough spot:\n\n- Bad demographics (not enough kids)\n- Not enough consumers\n- No military\n- Precarious geographical position\n- Internationalized manufacturing\n- Energy comes from Russia\n- Dependent on trade for 2/3 of GDPRussia also in a tough spot:\n\n- Bad demographics (too many old &amp; sick)\n- Need to annex countries (Ukraine, Baltic States) just to be physically secure &amp; will do once they're sure NATO &amp; U.S. is goneBritain also in a tough spot:\n\n- Will lose access to European market b/c of Brexit\n- Will beg U.S. for trade deal and accept U.S. demands which will put them in competition w/ Mexico\n- London loses its place as financial center of the world, which it had b/c it represented EUBrazil also in a tough spot:\n\nThe Brazilian situation has only really been successful in an era where global capital costs are low, global transport is safe and global demand for the products is bottomless, which has been true since 1995.\n\nNot anymore.Middle east = chaos.\n\nB/c of shale revolution, everything that's kept the U.S.  bound to this region (i.e. oil) is no more\n\nThat cuts Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia's biggest economic lifeline. They were basically rentier states w/ one commodity\n\nRebuilding that economy will take centuries.Ironic that the countries most hateful of the global order and U.S. management of it (e.g. Iran, Russia, somewhat China) are its biggest beneficiaries, &amp; will suffer the most when it's gone.\n\nAll U.S. has to do to destroy these countries is go home. And that's what they're doing.U.S. Politics\n\nElectoral college incentivizes split into two parties\n\nParties have a choice of casting wide net or forming alliances\n\nDemocrats cast a wide net, Republicans form alliances\n\nDemocrats have more factions, but more voters. Republicans have fewer #s, but more coherentFactions are reshuffling.\n\nTrump has excised national security conservatives, &amp; fiscal/biz voters from republican coalition, &amp; courted new factions (e.g. labor)\n\nDemocrats reoriented too (e.g pro-immigration)\n\nReshuffling is common: https://t.co/G9yCiJAq3XNo matter what, The U.S. is condemned to be an economic, financial, cultural, industrial, &amp; military superpower, per Zeihan. \n\nDecades of bipartisan effort have yet to screw this up yet, &amp; likely won't in 2020.\n\n/FIN\n\nTo learn (much) more, read the book:\n\nhttps://t.co/t1Qhuo2NW2Curious for all feedback &amp; counter-arguments.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed @PeterZeihan's latest interview w/ @patrick_oshag: https://t.co/c7Wv3hwlFI",

You sum up what people think &amp; converge on truth.\n\nIf they are succumbing to groupthink, peer pressure or preference falsification, then it's Madness.Enlightenment vs Christian view: Wisdom of crowds vs Madness of crowds\n\nWisdom is only when ppl are making decisions as individuals. You sum up what ppl think &amp; converge on truth.\n\nIf they are succumbing to groupthink, peer pressure or preference falsification, then it's Madness.Innovation tends to happen in highly networked ecosystems (h/t \"Where Good Ideas Come From\")\n\nBut there\u2019s a point where the network effects\u2014the fact that everyone\u2019s connected &amp; knows what everyone\u2019s thinking\u2014leads to everyone thinking the same thing &amp; shifts to madness of crowds.The madness starts innocuously, at, say, prestigious MBA programs.\n\nWhen you take ppl who are extremely socialized &amp; talented but who have relatively few convictions of their own, &amp; have them talk to each other trying to figure out what to do, they end up converging on safe pathsThose paths aren't as safe as we think\n\n1990 they all wanted to work for Michael Milken one or two years before he went to jail. \n\nThey only pursued SV in 1999 and timed the bubble perfectly. \n\nA lot of innovation depends on being immune from socialization.https://t.co/BEOObmKo8NThis goes beyond MBA programs. \n\nHenry Kissinger described the broader academic version of this: \"the battles in academia are so ferocious because the stakes are so small.\"\n\nWhen the differences are smaller, the stakes are higher for the same turf.Being highly networked and transparent has clear benefits, but also has costs.\n\nOne is that you're less likely to try anything contrarian if you feel you're always being watched.\n\nAlso if you're always being watched, someone will always find fault with you\nhttps://t.co/qVRisTTaenWe're less likely to take risks. \n\nSo we do things that look good to others, which means that others are doing them too, which means it's probably  hyper competitive, which means it's probably not a great idea.Competition makes us better at that which we're competing on, but it narrows our focus to beating the people around us. \n\nIt distracts us from things that are more valuable or more important or more meaningfulIt's amazing how these psychosocial forces homogenize people\u2019s thinking\n\nIt's not new\n\n90s - internet bubble\n2000s - housing &amp; finance\n2010 - gov't bubble\n\nAll characterized by a lack of critical thinking &amp; assuming that other people had figured things out &amp; deferring to them.Wisdom of Crowds vs Madness of Crowds:\n\nif you're 51/49 majority, that's probably more right than wrong: Wisdom.\n\nIf it's a 70/30 majority, well, that's even better. It's even wiser\n\nBut if you have a 99/100 to zero majority, you're North Korea: Madness.People tend to want to defer to the crowd, but at the end of the day, that\u2019s probably not how the system really changes. \n\nIt probably will be changed by some idiosyncratic people who have really strong convictions, and are over time, able to convince more people of them.In a hyperconnected world, it's harder to be eccentric (as a scientist, thinker, anything) b/c there's nowhere to hide.\n\nWe're all mad. Nietzsche said that madness is rare in individuals but in nations &amp; crowds of people, it\u2019s the rule. That was before Nietzsche himself went mad.For people to challenge convention they sometimes have to imitate what people with Asperger's do naturally: Be vaguely oblivious to it all and push forward.\n\nOr be hyper aware of consensus, and think from first principles so you can assess when it makes sense &amp; when it doesn't.\"We need to ask, what is it about our society where those of us who do not suffer from Asperger\u2019s are at some massive disadvantage because we will be talked out of our interesting, original, creative ideas before they are even fully formed?\" - Peter ThielThe challenge of crowds is that one submits to it.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of a very large crowd that\u2019s trying to do something, there\u2019s always this question, what\u2019s even the point b/c it\u2019ll happen anyway, you won\u2019t make that much of a difference relative to what you could otherwise do.It's dangerous to live in a world where people are super uncomfortable saying what they think.\n\nWe want to have debates on a lot of areas, and ask the hard Q's in science &amp; technology &amp; philosophy &amp; religion,  &amp; unearth the controversial but true ideas\n\nhttps://t.co/Ei6WhxUE5THyper-connectivity exacerbates the concerns ppl have around political correctness\n\nThe less privacy people have, the more pressure exists\n\nHow soon is it before we start monitoring minds for socially acceptable things to think? If the technology were there, we'd be doing it todayOriginality is hard. It goes against our instincts:\n\nAlready in the time of Shakespeare, the word \u2018ape\u2019 meant both primate and to imitate. \n\nThere is this imitation aspect to human nature that runs very deep. It\u2019s how we learn language as kids, it\u2019s how culture gets transmitted.But it also leads to many forms of insane behavior: peer pressure, market bubbles, cult religions, etc.\n\nIt starts by being able to tune out the people around you, being passionate about some idea or something more transcendent\u2014and, of course, being right.How does wisdom turn into madness?\n\nGirardian explanation: We want what other ppl want, leads into envy, that leads to violence.\n\nChristianity response: Don\u2019t look up to other people you compete with, look up to Jesus. Don't scapegoat &amp; purge others. Look within &amp; purge your sinsJohn Stuart Mill warned about the perverse effects of conformity centuries ago: \n\nHe also offered the moral argument behind his proposeed cure: pursuing individuality to strengthen collective knowledge.\n\nhttps://t.co/OLbMmCANT9",

Apple is employees &amp; investors, but it\u2019s also an entire ecosystem of goods &amp; services around its products, most of which it doesn\u2019t own. \n\nIt\u2019s the productivity benefits its customers get, millions of them small businesses.It's the second &amp; third order economic growth &amp; job creation in the communities in which it operates.\n\nIt's the training that it gives its employees and members of its ecosystem which grow human capital.\n\nIt\u2019s the education &amp; entertainment people get from the products themselves.Best argument *against* free trade?\n\nThere are many ppl in the US who aren't capable of adapting to a post-manufacturing employment\u00a0world.\n\nAnd so the choices are UBI or protectionism, &amp; latter is better because it's better to have ppl working than getting paid to do\u00a0nothing.What about security?\n\nWell, the more economically intertwined we all are, the less likely war\u00a0is.\n\n\"The best hedge against civilizational collapse is civilizational advancement, and entanglement.\"\n\nCoronavirus, however, could present unique challenges to this theory.What about China?\n\nThey're bad actors in this arena.\n\nThey're also likely growing in spite of their policies not b/c of them.\n\nThey are fostering domestic job growth at the expense of the quality of living for their citizens.\n\nFor them, that's a tradeoff they seem to be OK\u00a0with.Trade was also a huge debate in the 1980s/1990s as well, except then, instead of vs China, it was Japan, &amp; later\u00a0Korea.\n\n\"Competitiveness\" was the reason of the time for this topic, the idea being that we need to \"compete &amp; win\" vs Japan or they would \"compete &amp; win\" vs\u00a0the U.S.When people attack trade, what they are really unhappy with is the shifting composition of the underlying\u00a0economy\n\n+ they can't hold it back, since that's the result of actual technological progress resulting in shifting consumer wants &amp;\u00a0needs\n\nAnd so they go after the\u00a0foreignersPeople use trade as a tool to solve other problems, and those solutions end up making things\u00a0worse.\n\nAnd so using international trade to try to address systemic issues around the middle class is unlikely to work *even if* it is a logically sound thing to\u00a0doTalks &amp; readings that educated me, in addition to conversations w/ smart friends:\n\nhttps://t.co/9guCqsiwY0\n\nhttps://t.co/KWHB4xgMlH\n\nhttps://t.co/CvK3vhWy20\n\nhttps://t.co/oEZOp4uvsQ\n\nhttps://t.co/B1RjVuhH0Z\n\nhttps://t.co/3AvmNIiVrK\n\nhttps://t.co/2tcUKkfg1g",

One would be Oh, holy shit, and it freaks out and makes a bad decision leading to its death. \n\nThe other is to laugh it off &amp; keep searchingAS AN INVESTOR:\n\nWhen you start losing, &amp; you get stressed, you make worse decisions.\n\nIf you can remain calm and upbeat, &amp; at peak performance, even when you're getting punched in the jaw, it's an unbelievable competitive advantage. \n\nLaughing losses off helps redirect focusAS AN INVESTOR:\n\nStudying comedy means learning how to consider orthogonal perspectives that would surprise others.\n\nYou can use that to ask Q's like \"What would happen if a new regulation or technology came out tomorrow? How would that change the structure of this market?\"INTRODUCING IDEAS:\n\nif you actually want to know what's kind of on the edge of popular society, hang out at a comedy club.\n\nHumor is the mechanism where we sort out the grey area of what can&amp;can\u2019t be said...When a comic finds a funny joke, they're unearthing a truth that ppl are barely aware of, but then grasp that everybody else is aware of it, &amp; laughter ensues\n\nhypothesis: laughter is the sound of comprehension.We don't even have a good evolutionary explanation of what humor is\n\nAnd so we're trying to navigate what the rules of it should be without even talking about what its function is.Humor is the mechanism by which we sort out the gray area\n\nIf you cut that off and say, 'you can't say that', well, then, how exactly do we figure out where the line is? \n\nOne has to step beyond the line to figure out where the line is,&amp; if the room laughs, now you know somethingThat is to say: \n\nHumor treads at the edge, the fringe of consciousness, and that what happens when a comic finds a truly funny joke, is that they're unearthing a truth that people are only kind of aware of but it's so universal that the whole room suddenly grasps it.Comedy is an art form that includes, among other things,  offending surgically exactly who needs to be offended &amp; with minimal collateral damage.\n\nA great comedian is like a sniper: They take out the hostage taker and they leave the hostage intact.h/t @BretWeinstein @EricRWeinstein @SuperMugatu for these thoughts &amp; quotes.",

If Daryl Davis can have civil conversations with KKK and help them abandon it, you can understand them.Engaging in respectful dialogue doesn't mean accepting their conclusions\n\nIt means understanding not just what they believe but also why they believe it\u2014in that process, maybe they\u2019ll come to understand your reasoning, or see that their reasoning is in error, or vice versaAttempt to re-express their position so clearly that your target says, \u201cThat's right. I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that way.\"\n\nAssure common goals, values, and points of agreement.\n\nMention what you've learned from them.\n\nOnly after this should you utter a word of rebuttalMake your goals of collaboration and understanding explicit.\n\nSay, \u201cI'm really curious what you believe and how you came to believe it, it might inform my own thinking on the topic.\"\n\nLead with curiosity and ask yourself: \"Why do they believe that?\"If you think their motives are off, lead with curiosity: \"Could you tell me more about where you\u2019re coming from on that so I can understand better?\"\n\nIf you think they question your motives, say: \"I may be off here. If something is wrong with my reasoning, please let me know.\"If you try to change their mind directly w/ facts, they'll probably double down.\n\nInstead get them to explain their epistemology--how they know what they know. Ppl are far less defensive about this.\n\nEpistemologies:\n- Personal experience\n- Others believe it\n- Religion\n- EvidenceAsk \u201cWould every reasonable person draw the same conclusion?\u201d\n\nOr \u201cHow come there are so many divergent opinions? I mean, why is it that when 2 ppl look at the same evidence they come away with different conclusions? How does one figure out whose belief is true &amp; whose is false?\"Most people borrow second hand arguments from others (Unread Library Effect)\n\nHelping people understand they\u2019re relying upon borrowed knowledge leads them to introduce doubt for themselves\n\nConversely, if they have a sound epistemology they may convince you to follow their logicIntroduce scales:\n\nAsk, \u201cOn a scale from 1 to 10, how confident are you X is true?\u201d\n\nIf they say 8, \"What would move you to 6? to 10?\"\n\nSay \"I'm only a 3, can you walk me through how you got to an 8?\n\nDon't try to change their mind directly. Have them evaluate their epistemologyAsk Q's like:\n\nWhat evidence would cause you to change your mind?\n\nUnder what conditions could the belief be false\n\nWhat value does believing in it provide over not believing in it?\n\nDoes believing it make someone a better person?\n\nIn 10 years will you believe this?Try to be cognizant of ways you\u2019ve adopted essentializing views and work to uproot those beliefs in yourself. \n\nFocus on contributions over blame.\n\nInstead of saying \"X caused Y\" ask, \"What role, if any, did X play?\"\n\nLearn nonviolent communication: https://t.co/01foQ2oOPlModel the conversation you wish to have\n\n- Lead w/ curiosity\n- Be humble abt your knowledge. Say \"I don't know\" &amp; rate confidence from 1-10\n- Explain your epistemology\n- Change your mind upon hearing better arguments\n- Disavow extremists from your side\n- Steelman their side\n\n/FIN",

Most people aren't Bill Gates or Zuck\n\nFrom financial POV, study something technical from a great school\n\nEngineering degrees do well at all schools. Humanities only do real well at top schoolsIs this a ponzi scheme?\n\nWe have a federal loan program funded by the taxpayer such that students can go into debt &amp; then keep paying, via taxes to fund other people's debt. \n\nBoth K-12 and higher-ed are monopolies. Monopolies don't care to improve b/c they don't have to.They shouldn't be called public schools. They should be called gov't schools.\n\nWould you feel good eating gov't sushi? or driving the official gov't built car designed by the DMV?\n\nIf we don't do the above, why do we expect gov't to make schools w/ better results than sushi/cars?The great myth is that we've slashed funding for public education in the US over last 40 years. We've tripled it in terms of cost per student.\n\nAnd results have been flat. Massive price increase, no quality decrease\n\nWith colleges, gov'ts don't own them, but it's an oligopolyHow is it a cartel?\n\nAccreditation is a rigged process that keeps out competitors (last entrance into top 10 was Stanford over 100 years ago).\n\nNon-accredited universities don't benefit from tax breaks and federal subsidies &amp; loans so it's hard to compete.From tax POV: Colleges are allowed to run nonprofit at the operating level. \n\nAnd they're *also* allowed to invest their endowments, invest them on a nonprofit basis. \n\nSo don't pay taxes on operating income or investment income.\n\nHarvard endowment $40b. Tax sheltered hedge fundThe system is running as designed! \n\nThis is what happens when gov't restricts supply: price escalates. Quality remains stagnant.\n\nNot only that. Gov't also subsidizes demand w/ taxpayer funding, causing price to rise even higher.\n\nWe see the same thing in housing and healthcare.Re: housing. Cities are local monopolies over their own geography.\n\nThe housing policy in many big cities is \"don't build housing\"\n\nOnly 6000 new housing units a year. \n\nWhich leads housing costs to rise significantly.  Which leads gov't to subsidize demand (which caused 2008)What's the difference in a country like the US btw being middle class &amp; lower class?\n\nMiddle class can own a house, send kids to good schools, and get good health insurance.\n\nThose are 3 indicators of quality of life, and gov't has decided to take over and raise prices extremely.What are big questions right now?\n\n- will removing the SAT &amp; GRE dilute the signal?\n- how will colleges financially survive (bailout?)\n- will remote degrees matter as much as a credential?\n- will international students pay?\n- what alternatives will emerge?University format was standardized before the printing press.\n\nIf we built a new system today it'd look totally different. \n\nCOVID presents that option for reset: \"there are decades in which nothing happens.

And debt continues to go up.The average student graduating from college right now who has student debt is graduating with $29,000 in debt \n\nNow keep in mind, average student $29,000 in debt, half of the population has under $2,000 in liquid assets.\n\nAnd you can't go bankrupt out of that debt.That's unsustainable in a republican democracy\n\nThat's why we have populists on both sides saying \"You're getting screwed. I'll fix it\"\n\nBoth sides get so angry at each other they stop voting in their self-interest &amp; vote out of spite against the other\n\nThat's when countries failh/t @SuperMugatu for these ideas.

Customers aren't quite getting value, users are not growing quite that fast, word of mouth is not spreading, press who use it are a kind of blah, and the sales cycle takes too damn long.\"Andreessen continued:\n\nBut you can always feel it when product market fit is happening. Customers are buying as fast as you can add servers, you're hiring sales and support as fast as you can, ...money is piling up in your checking account, investors are staking out your house...Andreessen continued:\n\nDo whatever is required to get to PM-fit Including changing out ppl, rewriting product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don't want to, telling customers yes when you don't want to, raising that 4th round of dilutive VC\u2014AnythingAndreessen continued:\n\nConversely, you see a surprising # of really well-run cos having all aspects of operations completely buttoned down, HR policies in place, great sales model, ... outstanding catered food, top tier VCs, heading straight off a cliff due to not finding PM-fitThese are all great, but they're lagging indicators.\n\nSean Ellis found a leading indicator\u2014measure how many users would be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product.\n\nCompanies w/ over 40% often grow easily. Opposite for under.\n\nIf you have 40%, invest in growth.Survey: \n\n1/ What is it that ppl love about X?\n\n2/ What holds ppl back from falling in love w/ X?\n\nIf they love product for same reason, just find more of that user.\n\nSpend 1/2 time doubling down on what users already love about X &amp; other 1/2 on what\u2019s holding others backIf you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score won\u2019t increase. \n\nIf you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you. \n\nThis insight can guide your product planning process, effectively writing your roadmap for you.Roadmap:\n\nTo stack-rank priorities, use a simple cost-impact analysis: label each potential project as low/medium/high cost, and similarly low/medium/high impact.\n\nImpact from solving held ppl back is clear from survey.\n\nImpact from doubling down on strengths is more intuitiveHighest Expectation Customer (HEC):\n\nPpl who enjoy your product for its greatest benefit\n\nNo massive consumer internet brand has ever grown primarily through viral loops or viral mechanics\n\nThey also always have virality through word of mouth\n\nWhich is why HEC's are so important.Recap: \n\n1/ How would you feel if you couldn't use X? (very, somewhat, or not disappointed)\n\n2/ What ppl would benefit most from X?\n\n3/ What's main benefit you get from X?\n\n4/ How can we improve X?\n\nSend survey to ppl who've used X at least 2x in 2 weeks. ~40 responses is enoughSABR:\n\n1- Segment to find supporters &amp; paint a picture of your high-expectation customers (very disappointed)\n\n2- Analyze feedback to convert on-the-fence users into fans\n\n3- Build your roadmap by doubling down on what users love and addressing what holds others back\n\n4- RepeatIgnore customers who either\n\n- wouldn't be \"very disappointed\" if X went away AND/OR\n\n- don't experience the main benefit as your high-expectation customer\n\nDo cater to the needs of customers who would be very disappointed and/or the ones who share the main benefit as your HEC.Ignoring the \"somewhat disappointed\" will be hard.\n\nThey\u2019ll request distracting features, present ill-fitting use cases &amp; be very vocal, all before they churn out and leave you with a mangled, muddled roadmap\n\nActing on their feedback will lead you astray on your quest for PM-fitMaking sure you pick the right customers (&amp; keep the wrong ones out) is *critical*\n\nBy focusing on the right customers, you get more relevant feedback, you learn faster, you increase NPS, you get more word-of-mouth virality, with the community that matters most to you.PM-fit measures dependency on a product, either because there's such a strong emotional connection or because nothing else exists quite like it.\n\nNPS score measures how strong your word of mouth effect is likely to be in others.\n\nYou need both, but figure out PM-fit first.Metrics:\n\nYou don't want your churn to be more than 6-7% month to month or you're going to have a very hard time building meaningful business. \n\nFor a single player subscription tool, 2-3% month to month is greatIs this a full proof plan to PM-fit? Not exactly.\n\n3 reasons why companies may fail even w/ PM-fit engine:\n\n1- Running out of money before they finish this process. \n\n2- Co-founders breaking up.\n\n3- Giving up. \n\nIf PM-fit score is 5-15%, Rahul recommends reconsidering the productPricing: \n\n1- Understand competitive environment. \n\n2- Come up w/ positioning \n\n3- Develop pricing \n\nAsk your target users four questions:\n\n1- At what $ would you consider X to be so expensive that you wouldn't consider buying it?Pricing: \n\n2- At what price would you consider X to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn't be very good? \n\n3- At what price would you consider X to be getting expensive? \n\n4- At what price is X a bargain?\n\nOnly lower price if land-grab or 1st-mover advantageOn launching:\n\nReid Hoffman: \"If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.\"\n\nThis applies to startups creating new markets, esp w/ network effects (LinkedIn, Airbnb)\n\nIn existing markets w/ great products, bar is different (E.g Notion)On launch:\n\n\u201cA startup should only launch for one of three reasons: \n\n1- You need more users or customers to sell to. \n\n2- You need more capital to spend. \n\n3- You need more candidates to hire.\u201d/FIN\n\nI also recorded a podcast w/ @rahulvohra and @toddg777 about their new angel fund, and other company-building topics.\n\nhttps://t.co/lypbaW3g5t",

You're going to look for the wrong in everything the other side does and you're not going to look to work together.Social Media amplified this.\n\nSince people are arguing in public, they're tempted to show off &amp; win as to not look weak.\n\nYou get \"credit\" for tearing other side down publicly, not having a constructive convo privately\n\nDoes it change them?

Should we be doing more to cure cancer? Should we doing more to cure Alzheimer's? \n\nThe answer is yes https://t.co/u1kRbTO3H5The question isn't: do you get a pill that can make you live to 1000? That's too abstract and ideological of a way to frame it.\n\nAnswering that general Q positively makes you sound weird. \n\nBut saying no the specific Q's (cancer, dementia, arthritis) makes you sound cruel.The frontier of medicine today is different from the past, where death wasn't quite as linked w/ q's of aging, it was infant mortality, or the plague.\n\nToday the epidemics are of old age. E.g. Cancer you have 1 in 1,000 chance of getting it when you're 30, 1 in 10 when you're 80.Some people are scared about eugenics or Nazi experiments or Frankenstein experiments, but that's not happening. \n\nWe're not in the world of Los Alamos in 1945. \n\nWe're in a world of Epicurean hedonism &amp; complacency, where the dominant idea is that there's not much you can do.And our culture says you should just accept it, you should accept the stagnation of your lives, the stagnation of the West, you should accept the idea that the younger generation will do less well than their parents. And that's the light motif of our time.We talk about living forever, but the truth is, we have trouble curing toenail fungus\n\nWe have about 100 times as many scientists today as we had in 1920. And yet progress is about the same rate, probably even slower\n\nIt's not b/c low hanging fruit has been picked, it's culturalCultural problems:\n\nScientists under age 40 make most of the big discoveries and yet 2% of NIH grants go to scientists under age 40\n\nPeer review process where nothing heterodox can be funded\n\nPublish or perish dynamic, where they focus on incremental instead of fundamental.Bob Laughlin won Nobel Prize in Physics in 90s. \n\nHe then researched an area far more controversial than climate science or evolution: How much actual important work was being done by his colleagues. Not much, it turns out. He got blackballed, despite his Nobel Prize.Propaganda narrative among scientists b/c they're in in a Malthusian struggle against fellow scientists to get money from the government and the way that Malthusian struggle works is you lie and exaggerate more than your fellow scientists.Cultural stagnation:\n\nin 1960s ppl said don't do cigarettes b/c you could work harder &amp; be smarter. That's not zeitgeist of our time\n\nThe zeitgeist today is marijuana. It's opioids. It's ppl in their 20s living in their basements playing video games, amusing themselves to deathBut evolution! \n\nhow far one should apply evolutionary logic the evolutionary paradigm to to humans? \n\nIn a business context, whenever someone mentions evolution, they're about to do something extremely cruel. They're about to fire somebody for no good reason at all.There are continuities w/ humans &amp; animals, but also discontinuities.\n\nOne of the one of the great discontinuities, is that is that we are aware of our deaths.\n\nSo Darwinism isn't the way to make sense of death. Neither is Nietzche who said we need to go back to nature.\"I remember when I first experienced this as a 3 year old child sitting on this rug made of cow in my parents apartment building. What happened to the cow, the cow died. This was extremely disturbing. But I can't go back to when I was two years old. I can't become the cow.\"These other myths around death don't make sense either:\n\nNationalist myth: Meaningful to die for your country\n\nNon-Christian Religious myths: Worship the spirits of the dead\n\nLenin: You need to break some eggs to make an omelette (wut lol)\n\nMeaning isn't inherently found in deathAt the heart of the cultural malaise of the West is there's no longer teleology, nor the sense of a limitless open future of our society.\n\nthe default atheist position ends up being epicureanism. It's, you know, eat drink, be merry, for tomorrow, you may dieThere needs to be teleology. If only an atheist project, it'll collapse. \n\n\"You know, atheists are very motivated when they're young. \nI have nothing against atheists. I have nothing against old people. I don't like old atheists. They just don't work very hard anymore.\"\"Teleology is like a woman of ill repute. Nobody wants to be seen with her during the day, but many use her at night.\"Common criticisms: inequality, boredom, space for young people\n\n\"If you're talking to a five year old who says they're bored, the answer isn't, you know, hope you're gonna die soon\n\nIf you're concerned about inequality, the answer isn't, well, everybody should die so we're equal\"Conclusion: \n\nWe're not in a promethium science moment, like Los Alamos in 1945. Instead, we're in an Epicurean world of stagnation &amp; bureaucratization.\n\nThat's the cultural battle we need to fight in order to focus on longevity and, more broadly, reverse the decline of the West.",

Important for any good w/ high fixed cost and low marginal cost (software)\n\nSubstitute: Opportunity cost for innovating vs copying what's already worked elsewhere goes upGlobalization w/o tech breakthrough makes sense on a micro level but breaks down on macro level.\n\nIf you look at US cars per capita and extrapolate to India, that can work for India. But if you extrapolate everywhere, oil will cost $300 a barrel and we'll have a global depressionThe future effects of technology are hard to predict:\n\nWhen the transistor came out, people thought they'd be good for hearing aids.Why has science slowed?\n\nMany scientists had their breakthroughs in 20s.\n\nThe more advanced the state of the art is in any given field, the more of your time you have to spend just getting caught up\u2014&amp; thus you miss being able to contribute in what some ppl call your peak years.As population skews older, you have fewer people in the workforce and more people needing healthcare.\n\nOlder people are also more likely to vote (2 to 1), so politicians cater to their needs.US deficit in oil production was basically tying the global economy together.\n\nHad to keep Middle East stable, which meant had to keep everyone else stable too. US dependency on Middle East for oil was an implicit subsidy for the East Asian export driven economic success stories.Now that we are energy independent, doesn't make sense for us to intervene as much for oil.\n\nBut intervening might make sense to ensure the world is on our currency system, in our supply chains and in our cultural sphere.\n\nWar for oil was never popular. War for P&amp;G even less.What can we learn from east asian miracles?\n\nU.S. shouldn't copy blindly everything that they do anymore than they copied everything the U.S. did.\n\nBut they do prove state directed model can work, if competent.\n\nLesson: Make it high status to be in gov't so great ppl go there.Quoting someone else:\n\n\"There's only one thing worse than working than living under incompetent &amp; corrupt gov't. And that's living under an incompetent &amp; thoroughly honest gov't b/c at least in the 1st scenario, you can pay someone to let you do what you need to do.\"One reason why trade deficit doesn't matter as much:\n\nSince U.S. is a great place to invest in b/c of human capital, Maybe U.S. should be running a deficit because it's still the best place to put money, whether it's safe money in treasuries or risk capital in startups.China might be vulnerable:\n\nCCP derives political legitimacy from the fact that the economy is growing\n\nWhen U.S. struggles, they switch the president, but don't question democracy\n\nIf China had their own 2008, unclear it'd be the same. Propaganda campaign underway to make it soMental model of Trump:\n\nDespite many flaws, he's good at evaluating (&amp; memeifying) the weakness of others.\n\nIn real estate, he didn't buy a good area and improve it, he buys a disaster area &amp; makes sure lenders are more scared of him defaulting than he is.\n\nIt's a strategy.Charter Cities:\n\nGeography, demographics, resources, &amp; culture matter. \n\nDon't try to build these top down systems that can apply everywhere, instead adapt to local circumstances.\n\nYou can't just say if this country had U.S. institutions, it'd have U.S. GDP per capita.Charter Cities: \n\nUnlike startups, you have to worry that incumbents will literally kill you if you threaten them.\n\nYour best case scenario is the Bin Laden option where you have this extremely depressing life where you're waiting to get killed\u2014&amp; then you get killed. Be careful.Anti-tech in some sense is bi-partisan.\n\nLeft says we're concerned that people might not be getting ideas from approved sources.\n\nRight says we're don't like these techies doing drugs at Burning Man.\n\nBoth worry about 7 yr olds w/ smart phone addictions.\n\n(Caricatures of views)Response to tech-lash? \n\nCompanies get less ambitious.\n\nMicrosoft got less ambitious after anti-trust, which is partly why it missed mobile but also is least threatening of all tech giants. \n\nThe monopolies always pretend to not be monopolies.Malthus was actually correct that higher crop yields did lead to faster birth rates.\n\nWhat he didn't foresee was that the shift from manual labor to producing food led to longer career investment &amp; thus people delaying getting married until they're older (&amp; thus having less kids)Progressives &amp; Conservatives are confused.\n\nProgressives have adopted conservative puritan view that man is intrinsically sinful &amp; should subvert himself to the not sinful.\n\nConservatives have adopted progressive view that good institutions can change ppl (e.g democracy in Iraq).Progress studies itself is fundamentally agnostic. \n\nJust focused on increasing productivity, rather than asking who wins, who loses.\n\nIt's anti-partisan in the sense that partisanship tends to arise when we become less productive, that's when politics becomes more zero sum.Why we're polarized (besides slow growth)\n\nInternet means more news outlets that appeal to niche interests.\n\nSocial media means it's easy to get the propaganda you want.\n\nYou can choose media outlets that are going to outrage you in the precise way you want to be outraged.Peak California:\n\nHousing shortage means rents go up in line w/ cash comp, not equity comp, &amp; that means that incumbents have a recruiting advantage over startups.\n\nIn other words, high real estate selects against early stage companies &amp; selects for later stage companies.Stanford boiled down is an acceptance letter, a network, and a job fair at the end.\n\nYC realized you could do this in 3 months instead of 4 years\u2014and that equity was a better business model.\n\nLike Stanford, the more it succeeds, the more it becomes a monoculture.What Pinker gets wrong:\n\nThe distribution of extreme violence is such that the trailing mean is always lower than the the actual underlying mean.\n\nHe's correct about what a linear extrapolation from the historic data tells you, but wrong about the nature of that distribution.Darwinian case for monogamy:\n\nIncreases the chances that you'll be loyal to each other &amp; dedicated to their kids\u2014who are then more likely to do the same for their kids.\n\nCounter argument is that a lot of artistic and intellectual achievement doesn't come from normie familiesAustrian economics:\n\nBoom &amp; bust cycles don't just happen in gov't, but also in private business.\n\nThey tend to predict bubbles too early and that's why you'll tend to make more money betting on the bubble &amp; going along for the rideLessons from Alan Greenspan:\n\nIf you want to positively impact the world, you can either have great ideas or do whatever it takes to implement them.\n\nSomeone has to do the latter, dirty work. What's the point of having brilliant theorists whose theories never get implemented?Ideal education:\n\nKids should find a topic they're passionate about, dive into it in as much depth as possible, just nerd out to the maximum extent possible, &amp; then find something else wants once they've either reached the limit of their abilities or their interest has wanedOnline filter bubbles are bad, but real world filter bubbles can be good.\n\nThey can be safe spaces for people who have heretical ideas to mold them until they're ready to be shared.\n\nSafe spaces for people who don't want to be merely mimetic.Equality\n\nWealth gets more unequal, but consumption gets more equal (which is why the gap btw a billionaire's life and our lives is smaller than it used to be). \n\nOvertime, wealthy end up w/ larger share of country's resources, until a war or plague and that all gets wiped out.Role of gov't &amp; wall street: \n\nCoordinate behavior at scale to pursue a distant objective.\n\nThey both coordinate a lot of behavior that is optimal when it happens in parallel, but not that useful if it happens in sequence. (E.g Apollo)Bubbles happen when some people say the price is too high, others are saying no it\u2019s early ppl will make so much money (e.g internet bubble dot com optimists were actually right).\n\nBut the ones who got optimistic at the wrong time lost a lot of money.Equity bubble\u2014The future will be very different from the present &amp; you want to own equity in that future. We all try to be different\n\nCredit bubble\u2014future will look exactly like the past only more. Ppl who owe us money will continue to service the debt. We all try to be the sameNepotism is a credit market for reputation rather than cash.\n\nLike financial banks, there are social capital \"banks\" willing to lend social capital to ppl who don't need it and not willing to risk social capital on new &amp; risky people\n\nNeed to incentivize social capital investingSocial capital bubbles:\n\nIf there are just more people willing to vouch for more people, then you end up with too many bad ideas getting funded.\n\nAnd you also end up with people optimizing for getting recommended versus optimizing for building something goodSocial capital isn't like the economy where you can tinker w/ interest rates &amp; inflation.\n\nSo in that sense of status market is maybe analogous to the gold standard where there can be inflation and deflation and they're actually somewhat exoticness to the systemMy conversations w/ @ByrneHobart here:\n\nhttps://t.co/OP95Sbokvq\n\nhttps://t.co/qcDHNenO56\n\nSign up here to read more.

USSR was loyal. China is loyal.\n\nRich people aren't loyal. They have too many good options.\n\nYou're only as loyal as your options.Socialism didn't work in the west, b/c ppl got too rich.\n\nMore specifically, ppl believed in The American Dream, that they too could get rich if they worked hard &amp; had talent.\n\nFrom a Status calculus POV, it made more sense to believe in capitalism than socialism.\n\nBut today?This is why economic growth is so important.\n\nWhen we're not growing, the world becomes zero-sum. \n\nThere's a winner for every loser, &amp; ppl focus on capturing their piece of the pie instead of collectively expanding it.\n\nLow growth presents ripe conditions for Marxism.\n\nLike now?Remember, politics is similar to economics. It's about capturing as much power as possible\n\nIn economics, you do that by giving customers what they want\n\nIn politics, you do that by giving voters what you want\n\nWhat do lower status ppl want? Higher status\n\nhttps://t.co/hGCtVeTt4aWhich is why Marxism is a highly effective strategy, especially when people aren't getting rich.\n\nElections are won by majorities. \n\nWhat politicians do is say to lower status people: vote for us, and we'll give you high status. \n\nDon't vote for us, and you'll remain low status.They don't even have to deliver on their promises.\n\nThey're inherently against the establishment, they can just keep blaming the establishment for the lack of change\n\nBeing unreasonable gets you more loyal followers than being reasonable, b/c reasonable people have more options.So what's Cultural Marxism?\n\nEconomic Marxism didn't work b/c social class isn't a strong enough identifier. Once you get rich, you stop being loyal. And ppl wanna be rich\n\nAlso, capitalism provided a counter vision\n\nSo overtime, ppl saw how rich the west was getting &amp; lost faithWhat's a better identifier? Well, identity. What you can't change: Gender, race, etc.\n\nThose are identifiers on which people will always be loyal.\n\nAnd so there's a huge opportunity to capture votes by appealing to those axes.\n\nEven when they get wealthy, they'll always be loyal.What they did was stick to the structure: promise high status to lower status people. \n\nBut they changed the content, adapted to the new era\n\nNow people weren't poor b/c class warfare, it was because of oppression\n\nIt spread wildly. Its foil is capitalism: https://t.co/xluhnAtug6Communism lost partly b/c there was an attractive alternative in the west.\n\nAt some point Soviet communism became lower status than American capitalism.\n\nCultural Marxism has no such alternative to point to, so it's hard to switch.\n\nIt's is the highest status system in the world.Central to this theory is the belief that humans are wired to seek status\n\nAny good political agent will organize these ppl on the basis of increasing their status, the way any commercial agent will find a way to make money.\n\nEquality is an amazing path to power for a politician:If you\u2019re below average, \u201cequality\u201d sounds like \u201cboost in status\u201d, so inherently 1/2 population is always down\n\n&amp; the only way to enact this is to increase state power, which is why it's so politically appealing\n\nEasy way to get voters, &amp; easy way to justify expanding state powerCultural Marxism is less formalized than Economic Marxism was, partially because it can't be so explicit otherwise it'd be discredited.\n\nBut also because a distributed version (e.g. press, universities) is more effective. No central choke point. \n\nHow so?https://t.co/FeQhh7IhnSThis is why they are so anti-capitalist.\n\nIt gives people more options to get status, namely making money.\n\nWhen you make money, you don't care as much (e.g. China)\n\nMaking money makes people less dependent on them and thus less loyal.If it\u2019s easy to earn status through money, you\u2019ll get a house (or start angel investing)\n\nIf there\u2019s no way you\u2019re making any money, you need another path. Which path?\n\nWell you can always virtue signal\n\nThis is why they attack The American Dream: it's a threat to their powerHow else has it become so powerful?\n\nWithout religion, we take moral cues from our political tribes: https://t.co/PFvHp3Hgbv\n\nSay what you want about socialism, but it is a collective morality\n\nFreedom isn't a morality, or at least a collective one\n\nThis is why libertarians loseWait: How does Social Justice lead to Economic Marxism?\n\nZooming out: What's the end state where social justice would say, \"we accomplished our goal?\"\n\nAbsolute equality of outcome.\n\n(Logically, there is no equal opportunity without equality of outcome)\n\nhttps://t.co/MxZwxFBPyyThey deny it of course b/c it (communism) is politically unfeasible\n\nTo be fair, they genuinely don't believe they are advocating for it.\n\nIn practice it's: \"I would never advocate for Marxism, I just advocate for all of the policies that would create and enforce Marxism.\"Meaning: when the goal is economic \"fairness\", there's no morally acceptable line until you get to total equality of outcome\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say \"OK, we have economic fariness now\"\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say: \"OK, the government is sufficiently powerful\"\n\nIt's always more.There's no in-between.\n\nYou're either a total egalitarian or you're not. If you are, you sign up for the whole package.\n\nIf you haven't yet, that's just temporary. \n\nThere's no stable middle ground.\n\nOtherwise your position is philosophically incoherent &amp; you will have no allies.Christopher Caldwell's book talks about how civil rights was explicitly sold on the basis of equality of opportunity for one specific group, but immediately morphed into equality of outcome for every group, &amp; created legal precedent to enact it.\n\nhttps://t.co/mobzRlEC3wSocial justice aims to end all types of discrimination. \n\nInitially that was legal discrimination but over time the scope expanded.\n\nEquality (equal treatment) turned into equity (equal outcome).\n\nThat switch is how Cultural Marxism turns Economic. \n\nIt's a powerful wedge.",

Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles of company buildingThere is a narrative that founders have to either be college friends or worked together before\n\nI think this is less true than we think\n\nFounders of Coinbase initially met on Reddit I believe?\n\nFounders of Stemcentrx met on Craigslist!\n\nYou might be too afraid to fire your friendBack when, ppl were embarrassed to say they met their spouse via apps, &amp; instead prefer \"at a bar\".\n\nToday, a curated app sounds more thoughtful than the randomness of a bar.\n\nSo with co-founders too: We'll laugh at how we preferred the randomness of school to an app or program.Just like many marriages end up in divorce, and so it\u2019s worth rethinking the dating/matching process\u2014\n\nOne of biggest killer of startups is founder breakups, and so it\u2019s worth re-considering co-founder matching.If you don\u2019t already have a cofounder in your network, how do you \u201cdate\u201d?\n\nBuild top of funnel by:\n\n- Telling the world what you\u2019re thinking (e.g. writing a post, hosting a meetup, etc)\n- Join On Deck (https://t.co/dw9qXrOjiF)\n- Build an audience:What to look for in a co-founder?\n\n- Complimentary skills (how do you, together, have an unfair advantage?)\n- Value-mission alignment (what success looks like, etc)\n- Company alignment (who makes decisions, what tradeoffs you will/won\u2019t accept)You\u2019ve found the person, but you don\u2019t want to shot-gun--then what?\n\n- Go on a road trip or other intense experience (e.g. live together)\n- Do a hackathon (or work together in trying conditions)\n- Meet the spouse and/or parents if you can (seriously!)Non-obvious Q\u2019s to ask:\n\nIn what ways are you crazy? What are your failure modes?\n\nWhat was it like working with ex co-founders?\n\nIf this didn't work out, why not?\n\nWhat's most important to you ($? Managing People? Fame?)\n\nWho should be CEO? Who has the vision?When picking co-founders, it's important to know:\n\n\"Are you the co-founder who has clarity around the vision or are you the co-founder that's gonna build it?\"\n\nFailure mode: Both think they're in charge of vision, &amp; then they constantly butt heads over what direction to go in.Another common co-founder failure mode: Different goals.\n\nOne co-founder wants to make $50m from their startup in 5 yrs, and another wants to never sell.\n\nSometimes you can reconcile different goals, you just have to ensure they're not incompatible w/ each other long-termTalk early and often about:\n\n- What success looks like (outcomes, culture, roles)\n- Non-negotiables\n- Who\u2019s in charge in case of disagreement\n\nOn this last point: Make sure there is a clear CEO / tie-breaker\n\nWork together under stress early so you can simulate hard times.Early on also figure out:\n\n- Personal runway &amp; how much salary they'd need\n- Other extenuating life circumstances \n- 5-20 yr vision for their lives\n- How each wants to scale w/ the company\n- Equity split (prob 50/50)You don\u2019t need to be best friends. (Or even friends at all.)\n\nYou need to respect &amp; trust each other, communicate effectively, and work well together in accomplishing company goals. \n\nAnd not hate going to work every day.Cofounder relationships are like marriages, and should be treated as such\u2014something work on consistently.\n\n- Read relationships/communication books (e.g NVC)\n- Both see a coach\n- Date first. \"Try before you buy\"\n\nBut just like marriage, if it's too much work might not be a fit.What kills startups is never finding Product Market Fit &amp; co-founder issues.\n\nMinimize co-founder issues so you can maximize time spent on finding PMF.\n\nPlus, most co-founder issues stem from not enough PMF to begin with.\n\nSome stem from too much, but those are the good kind. :)Treat co-founder search like any other recruiting process:\n\nhttps://t.co/dCz3y47WX3",

Schramm's law: \"The single most important contributor to a nation\u2019s economic growth is the number of start-ups that grow to a billion dollars in revenue within 20 yrs.\u201dWe produce ~33 unicorns a yr. \n\nWe need ~100 unicorns a year to maintain post WWII growth rates.\n\nHow can we get more founders? De-risk it.\n\nMake median founder outcome closer to avg &amp; by removing economic friction. Remove other bottlenecks (thread)\n\nhttps://t.co/K9naMtc8QWIndeed: There are lots of VCs who could make great founders, who would actually prefer to build a business than do a financial services job, but they just prefer the economic calculus of venture capital. \n\nOthers, to be sure, are unwilling or incapable.\n\nhttps://t.co/KJXWgohcaAWe also should decrease cultural friction to starting companies:\n\n- celebrate starting cos as a thing for ambitious ppl to do globally\n\n- see startup failures on resumes as badges of honor instead of blemishes\n\n- create communities to find co-founders &amp; founder support(@beondeck)Other things holding founders back.\n\nStartup formation tropes are too romantic. e.g:\n\n- had an idea they were passionate about or were perfect customer for\n- knew co-founder since college\n- wanted to be founder, didn't \"stumble\"\n- founder was all-in.\n\nhttps://t.co/rurn6eT13iBut the real reason not to listen to VC advice b/c VCs don\u2019t listen to their own advice\n\nhttps://t.co/gqP55x8LzKIrony: Although VCs believe in markets, in some ways VCs are Central Planners\u2014a few partners deciding all investments (&amp; prices), across all sectors, geographies, &amp; people\u2014even tho they can't have perfect information on all.\n\nVenture Capital? More like Venture Soviet Russia. ;)Just as one person could have understood all of physics at one point, it was possible for one person to specialize at \u201cinternet investing\u201d and be an expert at all. \n\nThis is why we at @villageglobal (&amp; others) are trying to decentralize venture:\n\nhttps://t.co/E3ZOiUA7mfStartup investing\u2019s weird bc it takes 10+ yrs to be great\u2014not bc of skills gained but bc of feedback loops\n\nYou could invest for 3 yrs, be a beginner, go in a coma for 7 yrs, come back &amp; be known as an \"expert\", despite same level of skill\n\nIn which other field could this happen?Another VC/bball analogy:\n\nIn bball you can discover Giannis when he\u2019s 15 &amp; he can dominate day 1\n\nThe VC Giannis has to wait yrs for their dominance to be recognized\n\nThis suggests there\u2019s extra arbitrage in finding the VC Giannis\u2014the ppl who are already great but not legibly soPoker is a misleading analogy for VC, b/c it implies an equally distributed deck.\n\nA great firm gets pocket aces every time, a bad firm never sees an ace.\n\nWhat's hard isn't knowing how to play pocket aces, it\u2019s building the machine that repeatably gets pocket aces to begin with.In other words, ppl think VC is about sourcing, picking, &amp; supporting cos.\n\nInvesting isn\u2019t totally a craft (bc of long feedback loops), but it also isn\u2019t (all) abt luck, either. \n\nIMO it's about having a structural advantage:\n\nhttps://t.co/zgAy11P6lIVC is neither chess nor poker. It's more like war.\n\nIt\u2019s basically your ability to rig the game\u2014to build a machine that enables you to see &amp; get into the best deals.\n\nThat machine could be a reputation, a network, a platform \u2014but it has to be differentiated from other machines.More and more of seed investing is adding so much value to founders *before* they raise so that when they do, they feel compelled to make room for you.\n\nhttps://t.co/afJXAiJ3BLVC firms don't have many proprietary assets\n\nYou could steal Benchmark's playbook + it wouldn't change much, similar to how copying Lebron's regimen wouldn't let you compete\n\nPartially bc \ud83d\udc47, + also long feedback loops means VC brands are self-reinforcing\n\nhttps://t.co/utGJwQ5asmException: YC. \n\nThey changed the game by showing that VC could:\n\n- Scale founder support through...other founders (network effects)\n- Have portfolio diversity &amp; ownership &amp; keep quality high, debunked \u201cspray and pray\u201d\n- Be a franchise in Warren Buffet sense\n- Pricing powerDebunked following absolutisms:\n\n- VC has anti-network effects\n- Wide portfolios compromise quality &amp; support\n- VC is not a startup, product, or platform\n- There are no moats besides brand\n- VC has to be an artisan craft\n\nOf course, these are often true, but not alwaysVC narratives:\n\nVCs have magic so they can pick winners. \n\n*\"The Midas List\"*\n\nThey also have this magic where they can \u201cmake\u201d winners with their help and advice.  \n\nOnly they have the magic so they can only make a few investments so there\u2019s enough of the magic to go aroundIf as a VC you wanted to sound the most indispensable:\n\n- Startups are really hard to pick\n- VCs can uniquely help make companies great\n- Only ppl w/ VC experience can be good VCs\n\nYou\u2019d pick a GP-centric concentrated strategy!\n\nWider portfolio implies picking &amp; helping humility.In reality, diversified portfolios can make sense too.\n\nWhy? VC is a hits-driven business. The top 2.5% of vc-backed companies\u2014100/4,000\u2014make up all the returns.\n\nGetting into one of those w/ meaningful ownership is everything.\n\nAvg unicorn rate is 2.5%.\n\nhttps://t.co/yWJIONIJn3Your fund size is your strategy. \n\nYour best co will return 1/2 of all profit. And then the 2nd best might return a 1/4 &amp; the next best might return an 1/8 &amp; so on\n\nFor $100m fund, you need 1 co to return $150M, so that's 10% at 1.5B or 1% at 15B.\n\nNeed (meaningful) shots on goalIf you consider founders more helpful than investors, and investors not that a helpful, then what\u2019s actually most founder friendly is having a big portfolio\n\nWhich is why founders love YC\n\nAfter one institutional VC, there\u2019s serious diminishing returns.Follow-ons make sense most when they are doubling down or not at all.\n\nWhy? They are competing with every other opportunity out there, and artificially limiting to your own pool makes most sense when you have conviction.\n\nhttps://t.co/QZ33X4j00oFounders don't want to raise money from institutions as much anymore. \n\nThey want to raise money from individuals.\n\nHow VC got unbundled: https://t.co/716W2MjBYIVCs have to signal that\n\n- they have conviction in individual cos, but their incentive is to run a portfolio &amp; hedge their bets \n\n- they can uniquely help founders, but their incentive is to spend time finding new cos\n\n- they are builders too, but they're financiers 1stOne bearish take on VC value add is that, because capital is such a commodity, what's surprisingly helpful to founders &amp; angels when looking to fill out rounds is VC firms that decide quickly &amp; transparently.To be sure, VCs used to be able to add a lot of value. \n\n15 years ago, the VC who sat on 10 boards had genuinely novel info to share with a founder \n\nE.g. PM-fit, hiring, sales, fund-raising...\n\nNow 99% of startup questions are available via blogs &amp; online content.Getting a job in venture capital is partly less about \u201cwho you know\u201d and more about \u201cwho you\u2019ve helped.\u201d \n\nStart creating a personal portfolio of projects that allow you to help others, especially around getting into deals, and you may break into VC\n\nAlso: https://t.co/ncANag5MB1If you are looking to join a VC firm, the question the firm needs to be able to answer is:\n\n\u201cIs this person going to help me to invest in companies that I otherwise would not have invested in without him/her?\u201d\n\nHow do you do this?\n\nhttps://t.co/iLr4RPOtPwIf you\u2019re a up-and-coming VC trying to build a name for yourself I think there\u2019s a big opportunity in niche podcasting.\n\nMake the go-to-podcast for healthcare, VR, DTC\u2014pick any topic.\n\nIt\u2019ll build your network in that space &amp; you\u2019ll be the first person people think of for deals.Some smart person looking to break into venture should create a Stratechery for early stage VC.\n\nTake the fundraising announcements and explain &amp; analyze the broader trends behind them.\n\nOther ideas on breaking into VC: https://t.co/iLr4RPOtPwAirbnb Dropbox Coinbase etc\n \nIn ~every YC co, other VCs put in over 10x more $ +time.\n \nAnd yet, in founder interviews, YC gets comparable love.\n \nThat's the power of putting people in business, &amp; believing in people when others don't.\n\nBe first check in!VC is very reflexive: Perception becomes reality because of long feedback loops. Get #s on the board early then if you know you want to do it long-term.\n\nhttps://t.co/QYpGXYIHyCLPs don't want VCs to have big diversified portfolios b/c LPs  are already sufficiently diversified\n\nVCs don't want founders to diversify b/c VCs are already sufficiently diversified\n\nIt's Go All In or Go Home all the way down\n\nhttps://t.co/LWVlWakiFpHow does COVID-19 affect LP/VC market for new funds?\n\nSome thoughts paraphrased from a conversation with an older VC who's been through a couple cycles. Down pointing backhand index\n\n(Curious for alternative perspectives.)\n\nhttps://t.co/LrDwC2Ko9VHow do we fund science and longer-term projects?\n\nhttps://t.co/NHVOgDIWSUPre-seed is about proving customer value, not revenue.\n\nConsider a restaurant: The KPI to track is not whether customers ate &amp; paid, it\u2019s whether they finished their plates, took some food home, and came back again.\n\n(more wisdom from @AliBHamed)Series A is b2b, Seed is b2c.\n\nAt Series A, your customers are the founder + other seed firms\n\nAt Seed, your customer is the founder. You need to be top of mind b4 they start co. Wide net\n\nExplains why seed firms spend more time on Twitter &amp; later stage spend more time networkingOn VC/founder relationship being a marriage:\n\nMaybe a more precise analogy is a divorced couple w/ a kid. \n\nThere\u2019s some alignment, some misalignment\u2014sometimes they want you there, sometimes they don\u2019t\u2014\n\nSometimes you flourish as co-parents, sometimes they kick you out &amp; sue you.Future of VC:\n\nVC funds technical risk. \n\nInstead of MBAs running spreadsheets trying to figure out CAC to LTV, they\u2019re funding companies that are trying to cure cancer, develop flying cars, extend life, get us to the moon\u2026\"I would hope that people go back and look at 2018 and 2019 and say I can\u2019t believe that founders sold 50-80% of their companies before IPOs to pay for Facebook and Google ads. You\u2019re basically selling 50-80% of your company to Facebook and Google.\" - Andrew D'Souza\"VC branded itself well, right? You have these smart people who put together these fancy websites and basically said that if you raise from XYZ firm, you\u2019re going to be successful. But it was this false promise. It\u2019s caused cos to take capital they wouldn't otherwise - Ali HamedBeing a VC used to be about technical risk, then it evolved and became also about market risk. \n\nHow to evaluate markets?\n\nPeter Thiel vs Keith Rabois approach to markets\n\nhttps://t.co/VhERuXhCX1in 2005, PG discovered an arbitrage opportunity by identifying that young technical founders were being overlooked\n\nin 2019, with the rise of no-code &amp; the intense focus on technical founders, perhaps the pendulum has swung + a new arbitrage opp is biz &amp; product minded foundersDomain expertise is more important now\n\nSoftware's eaten low hanging fruit &amp; now going for more\n\nFor areas within logistics, healthcare, finance\u2014expertise &amp; relationships matter\n\nWe used to think only founders can learn domain expertise\n\nBut experts can also learn to be foundersMaybe this is why recently it seems VC partners have more leverage over their firms than they did before\n\nIf vesting worked differently, we'd likely see VC look more like NBA free agency--more switching. Maybe that changes overtime.\n\nhttps://t.co/9tL9PAp8NkThe venture firm that most captured where tech startup ethos was going in 2014-2017 was a16z imo.\n\nIn 2020 and beyond, esp if Warren wins, I think that leader may be Founders Fund (w a16z leading here too)\n\nThe difference between peace time and war time ethosIn the last decade, angel investing became a status symbol (in contrast to stodgy VC)\n\nIn the next decade, being a talent discoverer&amp;curator will become a status symbol (in contrast to transactional recruiter)\n\nISAs enable this: investments become person specific, not co specific",

Harding did nothing, it went back to 3%.People talk about the kind of the government has to intervene because we had, you know, 25% unemployment during the Great Depression. \n\nAnd what they don't understand is, there was only 25% unemployment after the government intervened.Ppl in different income brackets are discussed as though they are different ppl, as opposed to to ppl at different stages of their lives\n\n56% of U.S. households will be in the top 10% at some point in their lives\n\nOf all the ppl in the top 1%, only 13% are in the top 1% for 2 yrsAnd the number who are in the bottom 20%, only 5% of them remain the next year. 29% of them will have gotten to the top, over 50% in the top half.\n\nAnd so you're comparing what happens to these abstract categories rather than what's happening to actual flesh and blood people?Bottom 20% of ppl are mostly: young ppl, old ppl, &amp; immigrants. The fact that young ppl &amp; new immigrants have low income is no surprise...they're just getting into the game. And the fact that old ppl have low incomes also isn't surprising...they aren\u2019t in the labor force anymore!What you\u2019d really want to see is a cohort chart where you see what happens to people who start in each bucket over time \n\nWhen people say \u201cthe incomes of most American households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades\u201d they are painting a strawman.There is no such thing as a \u201chousehold\u201d. They vary over time. They vary from one group &amp; income level to another. \n\ne.g. there are 39M ppl in the bottom 20% of households, and 64M in the top 20%. So you're saying yes, 24 million additional people do tend to have more money.Over a period of about 30 years, the household income rose by only 6%. over those same years, per capita income rose by 51%. Because the number of people per household was declining all the while.There are a lot of people who regard so called disparities and inequities and income is something that requires some great explanation seem to assume that in the absence of some intervention, everyone would have something roughly equal income.Constrained vision=Human nature is flawed, but fixed, so how do we erect institutions that contain our flaws?\n\nPpl's outcomes are often constrained by reality\n\nUnconstrained vision=Human nature is malleable\n\nThe unconstrained vision looks at pain &amp; says we must remove the painThere is no one who from sheer intellectual power can tell you what the law ought to be\n\nThe Q is, who shall have the authority to change that law &amp; with what constraints on that person so that that person is not just giving event to their own feelings or imaginings or theories?In order to win politically, ppl have to depict the problems in ways that will allow them to play the role of rescuers\n\nAnd so there\u2019s no talk about resilience or self-reliance. \n\nYou have to tell them their problems were caused by somebody else, otherwise why do they need you?Why it's bad to hate builders:\n\nB/c you attack the people who are creating the most wealth, not only for themselves, but society. \n\nPpl don't get wealth exploiting. They get wealth b/c others pay them b/c they are getting value in return.Ppl like to put down billionaires &amp; say they are exploiting the poor\n\nBut if you compare the data there are more billionaires in the U.S. than in Africa &amp; the Middle East put together &amp; yet the standard of living for the poor in the U.S. is higher than that of ppl in Africa + MEOn how Socialism stinks:\n\nRussia had all the natural resources you could imagine\n\nIt was the only industrial nation which has so much petroleum that they export oil\n\nAnd the irony is one of the world's great famines occurred in the USSR. How come? mismanagement by the gov'tTaxes:\n\nPeople get upset at billionaires for paying less in taxes as a % than their secretaries, but...fake news.\n\nFirst of all, the vast majority of taxes are paid by people in the upper 10% of the country\n\nIt may well be that if someone has capital gains, they'll pay lower rateEffect of tax cuts on the economy was to increase the rate of growth, increase the revenue received by the government. \n\nThe rich not only paid more taxes after the tax cuts for the rich, as they call it, they paid a higher percentage of all taxes.In the early 20s, the tax rate on the top income was 70%. The ppl making over $100,000 paid something like 30% of all taxes. \n\nBy the end of the decade, the tax rate on the top had been cut to 24% so ppl making over 100,000 now paid 65% of all taxes &amp; the reason is quite simple:That when you have a tax rate of 73% people simply don't pay it (i.e. find loopholes)\n\nSo it's the choice between a symbolic high tax rate on wealthy ppl to win votes\u2014Which the rich themselves are not gonna pay\u2014Or actual more tax revenue coming in to the gov't.Trickle down theory not a theory, it's a caricature\n\nPpl think if you cut tax rates on the rich, then there'll be less taxes for the government, or you'll have to raise the taxes on other people to make up the difference or cut programs and so forth. The above disproves that.Why are ppl poor?\n\nPpl are born poor. The Q is less why are ppl poor and more why are some ppl rich\n\nAsking this gives us an appreciation for what got us rich, (markets), and how we can get more ppl rich, rather than implying that the rich have gotten rich at expense of the poor.Higher Ed\n\nWhy has cost been rising?\n\nGov't. If tuition is over a certain amount, you get more gov't funding. Thus it incentivizes unis to charge more\n\nOne reason professors cost more is that their opportunity cost is higher bc they could get paid more to go into other industriesThis review gives more details: https://t.co/OvBrKNQIjL\n\nThe above tweets are just a tiny fraction of his ideas written over 30 books...",

Locks ppl into jobs &amp; taxes employment\n\nWrote this on opportunities in digital health: https://t.co/hpjDUeg3N7Why do employers pay for healthcare?\n\nRelic of WWII, where there was a wage freeze b/c of labor shortage.\n\nSo to attract labor, they started competing on benefits.\n\nFurther separates consumer from the cost of healthcare. Prevents some employees from leaving &amp; starting businesses.Small change that could be meaningful: \n\nMake any healthcare expense tax deductible or tax everything such that if consumers decide to go walk up to a hospital &amp; buy their own health care, then they can do that with the same tax equivalency as if they got it from their employersU.S healthcare quality is good, but bad at distributing &amp; financing it\n\nWHO ranking: If everybody gets A or B or C level care in country X, vs. another country where everybody gets C level care, country X w/ As, Bs, &amp; Cs gets worse ranking than the country that got everybody a CDifferent kinds of approaches:\n\nSingapore:\n\n- Only spend 4% of GDP on healthcare (In contrast to our 20%)\n\n- Only 30% gov't funded (in contrast to over 80% for us)\n\nHow? Combining best of private &amp; public.\n\nhttps://t.co/OQEwSoiC7TDifferent kinds of approaches to give everyone covered:\n\n- You can do government direct provision, the NHS model. \n\n- You can do single-payer, the Canadian model. \n\n- You can do regulation and cross subsidies, the Swiss or German models. \n\nThey can all workWe pick &amp; choose different models.\n\nFor under 65, we're Germany\n\nFor over 65, we're national insurance.\n\nFor military, we're Britain\n\nFor millions uninsured, we're Cambodia.\n\nAll the other countries have settled on one model for everybody b/c of expedience. Not us.U.S. Healthcare is worst of all worlds:\n\nPrices aren\u2019t set by the market, but they also aren\u2019t set by the government. \n\nWe simultaneously miss out on the efficiency of a purely private system and on the savings of a purely public one.Some elements of healthcare have free markets and work well. \n\nSee: LASIK surgery.\n\nSince it's not covered by most insurance plans, ppl have to compare different services, their satisfaction records, and their prices. In short, they shop around. Good ones succeed &amp; bad ones die.In healthcare, consumers directly pay for less than 15%  of it.\n\nThe government (via taxes) &amp; health insurers pay for the rest.\n\nMany of these procedures are optional\n\nIf \"Blue Shield\" was \"Blue Eats\" &amp; you could eat as much as you want after $300, maybe ppl would eat a lot more.Myths of other models\n\n- It's all socialized\n- Ration care w/ waiting list &amp; limited choice\n- bloated bureaucracy \n- insurance companies have to be cruel\n- won't work in U.S.\n- it has to be all gov't or all private o workEffects of Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n\n- Improved consumer protections\n- Limited deductibles\n- Dropped uninsured rate from 18% to 10%\n- Established baseline for essential health benefits\n\nBut also:\n\n- Didn't effect cost or move to \"pay for value\"\n- Compromised on many core aspectsBooks I read &amp; recommend:\n\n- Chronic Care\n- The Healing of America\n- Myth or Magic: Singapore\n- Where Does it Hurt?As always, LMK if feedback or additional context.

Or more precisely in this case, the love not given.\n\nAn acknowledgement of the subtle slights one faces b/c race. Helpful construct.\n\nTaken to the extreme tho, it can be a weapon where you can catch people &amp; invoke administrative power on your behalf.Andrew Yang was the Universal Man manifested.\n\nBecause as an Asian American, he's somehow apart. He could mediate in ways whites can't.\n\nHe won support from:\n\n- Al Sharpton\n- Alyssa Milano\n- Charlamagne Tha God\n- Bret Shapiro\n- Whoopi Goldberg\n- Tucker Carlson\n- Chappelle\n- RoganFinally, an Asian leader regarded as someone who has vision and not just some tertiary figure whose job is to work on the technical back end of things.\n\nThis mediating figure that nobody can quite attack, that everybody can coalesce around as a kind of compromise candidate.Paradox of Asians:\n\nThey're dramatically *over-represented* in terms of overall academic &amp; economic representation relative to their population\n\nThey're dramatically *under-represented* in terms of corresponding academic &amp; economic representation relative to their accomplishmentsBack to micro-aggressions:\n\nTaken to extreme, it can spiral, and everyone can turn into an oppressor on some axis.\n\nThe book \"Beauty Pays\" takes a look at the premium that attractive people &amp; tall people get in a pretty systematic fashion.\n\nhttps://t.co/jWWANDmagvThere's no immunological defense against any egalitarian claim rn.\n\nAs a result an administrative leviathan is being constructed, a sort of surveillance system meant to police wrongdoing.\n\nDespite the real harm of micro-aggressions, an excessive cure can be worse than the diseaseFree speech? Due process? Meritocracy?\n\nNew generations of college students have only encountered hostile critiques of these.\n\nThey've only read about social contract theory &amp; everything we've used to become a multi-ethic society as the will to power of an oppressor.Media too has been taken over by a sort of insurgency.\n\nIn the last few yrs (After \"Before Times\"), the ideology of Jezebel became something like the ideology of The New York Times.\n\nLeads to Rotten Tomatoes phenomenon: Chappelle panned by the press, loved by the wider audience.Which is why a mixed martial arts commentator (Joe Rogan) can get more traffic than The Washington Post &amp; NYT combined.\n\nHe's no genius, he's a surrogate for the normal person encountering all of this stuff &amp; looking for someone to make sense of it.\n\n(FYI Rogan supports Sanders)Asians are fighting back against social engineering in NYC school systems.\n\nThere's an anti-meritocratic movement that says meritocracy is white supremacy, and yet the group that is hurt most by fighting meritocracy here is Asians: They outnumber whites in these gifted schools.These aren't rich people. Asians have the highest poverty group of any group in NYC.\n\nThese are the earnestly striving children of working lower middle class, immigrants from China a pretty large percentage of whom are undocumented.\n\nThe ppl these programs are meant to help.There is a small minority speaking behalf of a larger majority, laundering their own individual psychopathology as a form of virtue and we're listening to them even though they don't represent the broader group (e.g only 2% of latinos identify w/ Latinx)\n\nhttps://t.co/Yijg9tthNXThese activists have read Foucault, Saul Linsky\n\nThere was this debate in the 90s where you had these activists monkeying around with definition of words &amp; the law, &amp; then you had the real activists on the front lines criticizing the former group.\n\nTurns out the former was right.And so we have law professors whose job is to dream up new ways to define harms &amp; remedies to those harms.\n\nThere's a smaller group of law professors whose job is to ensure the integrity of the law &amp; ensure its basic functioning\n\nOnce these things are laws, they're hard to repealParadox is that while wokeness seems to be subsiding in popular culture (see Ricky Gervais), it is gaining more and more power in the institutions (our education systems &amp; law)\n\nhttps://t.co/L6kTtmPNhTOur society is still healthy.\n\nThe freakout that's taken place in the media hasn't impinged upon our core institutions.\n\nAnd the fear is is that at some point, they will, at some point, make its way into muscle and bone and get into the structure of the society and turn it over.The work I'm doing now is trying to defend a space for people to be told that their perception that things are going crazy is correct\n\nThat normative behavior is routinely violated by institutions that used to be the gatekeepers of normative behavior\n\nWhat's true is still true",

How do we get back to an accelerating progressing world of science and technology? How do we reduce violence?\n\nUtopia: Cheaper energy sources. AI. Robotics, Space program. Nanotechnology, Cures for all diseases. New cities.His claim: economic growth has stalled. \n\nWe've had progress around tech, around this narrow cone of progress around the world of bits, but not atoms.\n\nThe iPhones that distract us from our environment also distract us from how strangely old &amp; unchanging our environment is.1973 Test: Go into a room and, besides the phones, try to notice what would be different from 1973.\n\nWe attend schools and sit in classrooms that are pretty much like parents &amp; grandparents. We live in houses not unlike theirs and drive in cars not unlike theirs.Deceleration in:\n\n- Biotech\n- Energy\n- Cleantech\n- Transportation\n- Food\n- Nanotech  \n- Education\n- Healthcare\n- Construction\n- Gov't\n\nAcceleration in:\n\n- Tech\n\nIT innovation hasn't been isn't enough to save the country, not even enough to save California.Tech itself isn't immune to stagnation.\n\nGoogle &amp; Amazon companies are worth perhaps 2-3x as much as all technology companies in the US combined created since the year 2000. \n\nComputer Rust Belt - Cisco, Dell, HP, etcUS has taken the future for granted, and has become too gullible.\n\nSavings rate of minus 6%. If you include government deficit spending, people think the future will take care of itself.\n\nOne bubble after another where people have been promised that the future will be fantasticWhy has this happened? Few different reasons:\n\nSome say low hanging fruit has been picked.\n\nPeter Thiel says it's something in the culture that's made us less ambitious, more risk-averse, scared to take ambitious swings\n\nhttps://t.co/T3cX1R3qpuThe easiest way to show this is if you look at all the movies that come out of Hollywood, name science fiction films that portrays the technological future in a positive light. It's often Terminator, Black Mirror, The Matrix, Avatar, etc\n\nThis is good. It means it can be changed.Surveys show that the majority of young people think they will be less well off their parents in the US. \n\nin Western Europe, even a smaller minority that thinks they will be better off than their parents.\n\n\"The Complacent Class\": https://t.co/nYh3UhyrZySV Propaganda says the opposite -- things are happening too much, people will be left behind.\n\nThis doesn't show up the data. 3.5% unemployment\n\nUBI is self-congratulatory &amp; pre-mature.\n\nIt's a trick to divert attention from the fact that we haven't been innovating enough.\"I'm always nervous whenever we're too optimistic or too pessimistic about the future, because it means that it doesn't matter what you do, if you're optimistic, the future will take care of itself. If you're pessimistic, we're headed the apocalypse. \n\nWhen really it's up to us.\"Climate change politics itself is anti-technological, anti-human. We need less people because people are bad. We need less tech b/c tech is bad.\n\nInstead of tech being the way out, and people being what creates tech \n\nhttps://t.co/xkbe2fU4vKPension funds try to make ~8.5% return a year so that everyone has enough to retire. If they don't get them, the people are screwed.\n\nThe only way you can get those kinds of returns, is if you have extraordinary compound exponential growth in science &amp; tech in the developed worldA big LP was telling Thiel they had 5% in VC and thought it too much.\n\nPT responds -- if the 5% doesn't return b/c not enough innovation, it's not the 5% you should worry about. \n\nIt's the 95% you should worry about, b/c it won't return either w/o innovations in science &amp; tech.The only way our societies have worked for at least 250 yrs is by economic growth.\n\nParliament democracies are built on an expanding pie that they can continue subdividing. Once the pie's no longer expanding, then everything turns zero-sum. (1930s was a bad decade for growth...)We need a return to long-term thinking.\n\nWe are too focused on hitting # s for the quarter, or winning that next election, to focus on 20 year issues. \n\nUS is better than China in every dimension except for this-- thinking long-term.We've had this extraordinary history of bubbles in the last few decades which clearly had a psychosocial component where people were not thinking very much for themselves. Internet bubble in 90s, housing/finance in 2000s, gov't bubble now.Often, these things were characterized by extreme lack of critical thinking, deferring to groupthink\n\nThus, suspicion is always when there's speech that is completely forbidden &amp; Q's that aren't allowed to be asked, normally you should assume that those things are simply true.Silicon Valley has a conformity problem. Intellectual monoculture.  \n\nSilicon Valley 1997: Think different  \n\nSilicon Valley. 2018: Think the sameThe US is living in an increasingly competitive world. \n\nMarginal tax rates at 40/50%, relative to 10% in other countries.\n\nThe focus on whether rich are paying their fair share is to miss the bigger point of whether US can compete globally.There are two kinds of ways things can go wrong. \n\nOne is for ideas never to be questioned. And then the other one is for them to be questioned too quickly, distorted and, and mischaracterized. \n\nHeterodox ideas are questioned too aggressivelyCritique of Left:\n\nThe distraction machine has been driven by identity politics. It's subscale. We don't think of the country as a whole, we think of just subgroups within the country, and I think there's something insane, self-contradictory about identity politicsIdentity means what makes you unique. Here it means what makes you the same. \n\nUntil the left is able to move beyond identity politics, it's not going to be able to focus on the scale that we need to be focusing on for this country.Critique of right:\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is religious in its way of resisting inquiry and distracting us from our problems. Too much scale.\n\nIt leads us to being exceptionally unaware, overweight, inefficient. \n\nThe solution to exceptionalism is to settle for greatness.The left is focused on unjustified nature of violence, the  right is focused on the amount of violence  needed for society \n\nThe nation state contains violence in both sense of the word \"contain\" -- it limits the channels but it's also part of its very being.I'm skeptical of copying things. \n\nTo the extent you're trying to copy Silicon Valley, you're ready putting yourself in some in a weird derivative position. You know, you don't want to be the Harvard of North Dakota.\n\nThe something of somewhere is often the nothing of nowhere.Media:\n\nThese were incredibly robust monopoly businesses in the 1980s and 1990s. And if you worked at a newspaper, you it's like, you were working at a utility company had this, you know, cushy, fairly secured position, because you were a local monopoly.Media continued: I think the monopolies that media enjoyed were, in some ways, good b/c they provided a positive externality for our society.\n\nYou normally don't like to say, you know, I'm working at a monopoly company, and that's why we're doing so well. But that's what it was.Media continued:\n\nThis intolerance has taken on some bizarre forms. One magazine praised me as a gay innovator only to later say  I'm not a gay man b/c I don't agree with their politics. If you don't conform, you're not diverse, regardless of your personal background.There is \u201cthe myth of the lone genius\u201d (not belief in the lone genius, belief in the mythicism of it)\n\nWe are glad that there is online retail, but we don't appreciate Bezos\n\nOnline retail came into being b/c Progress. Bezos is just some annoying guy who captured credit &amp; profitsWe're  stuck in nostalgia.\n\nWhen was the last time a politician gave a speech in which he or she portrayed a future that looks really different from the present. MLK \"I have a dream of painting\"  Reagan, \"Mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall\". Ppl don't believe in the future anymoreThe power of positive thinking is unclear \u2014 If you think you can, you *might* \u2014 but the power of negative thinking is much clearer: If you think you can\u2019t, then you won\u2019t.One critique of SV Valley: many successful ppl have Asperger's. \n\nAnd I think we need to flip this around into an indictment of our broader society: \n\nWhat is it about our society where the rest of us are talked out of our most interesting ideas before they're even fully formed?Because just as people want to have monopolies, they want to also downplay them. \n\nOnce you think of a monopoly is simply an absence of competition, you might start noticing a few yourself, what's a patent, if not a monopoly backed by the government?Advice for younger people:\n\nValue substance more than status. Consider your projects: Are you doing it for the prestige? What do you truly believe about the world? \n\nGo long substance, short status.China propaganda narratives:\n\n1\u2014China is very far behind us, there\u2019s no need to worry about it\n\n2\u2014China is so far ahead off there\u2019s no way we can catch up\n\nDenial is extreme optimism, acceptance is extreme pessimism\u2014extreme optimism &amp; extreme pessimism converge to doing nothing.There's a generational problem where it is difficult for young people to acquire capital b/c:\n\n1\u2014education. $300 B student debt in 2000. $1.7 T today. Can't default on it\n\n2\u2014housing. main way middle class accumulates $ is through real estate. bad urban zoning laws make that hardLack of ideological diversity in education:\n\n\"If you're the only law professor at a top law school to endorse Trump, I think there would be like a 50% chance you would've gotten nominated to the Supreme Court or something like that. And yet no one does...Something's up\"\"When I started PayPal in 1998, one of the Q's I was always asked was why can't a big bank just do this? I never really had a good answer to it. \n\nI now think the answer is roughly that most big corporate institutions are just political, slow, &amp; bad at innovating.\"\"Elizabeth Warren got more donations than anybody else [from Silicon Valley]. And so if she were to get elected I think she would be able to argue that even the ppl at the big tech companies think they should be destroyed.\n\n...SV is completely deranged\"Three pictures of a very different future in Europe:\n\n1- Islamic Sharia Law\n\n2- Chinese Communist AI (eye of Sauron watching you at all times &amp; places)\n\n3- Green movement\n\n\"This is why green stuff has so much traction in Europe. If these are the only 3 options...I'll go w/ Greta\"American Exceptionalism is a radically monotheistic God, where it's so one of a kind &amp; so different that it can't be compared or measured in any way.\n\nAn alternative is something more like greatness, where it's a comparative function and we would ask how are we stacking up?\"The Q question about the rate of progress of science, of innovation, is incredibly unquantified...and if you have this  hand-waving where everything's exceptional...then there's no ability to really keep score, and you are certainly not exceptional and you're not even great.\"In last 5 yrs if you had crazy ideas, if you had ideas that were outside the box, those were always bad and you got clobbered and you couldn't get tenure etc\n\nThe Overton window is so uncomfortably narrow that I would be long ideas more than at any other point in the last 50 yrs\"Diff btw battle w/ China &amp; Cold war:\n\n1- Information Age, not industrial age.\n\n2- Global competition Q.\n\n3- Economies are very deeply connected. We weren't deeply connected to the USSR.\n\n2020 isn't like 1989 or 1951, 2020 is like 2020 which is much less helpful but more accurate.Extreme optimism &amp; extreme pessimism are both equally wrong. \n\nWe should always come back to the Q of individual agency instead of grand narratives\n\nThere's always room for history, there's always room for new ideas,&amp; these things are never definitively decided 1 way or the otherTo create a valuable company, you have to create something of value &amp; capture fraction of value you\u2019ve created\n\nU.S. airline carriers:\n2012 revenue: $195.6 B\n2012 profit margin: 0.2%\nMarket cap: $112.4 B\n\nGoogle\n2012 revenue: $50.2 B\n2012 profit margin: 21.0%\nMarket cap: $393.8 BThere are 2 kinds of businesses: Those that are perfectly competitive, and monopolies. They both pretend they're the opposite.\n\nMonopolies pretend they\u2019re in high competition to avoid regulation\n\nCompetitive businesses pretend they\u2019re unique to attract capital, differentiate, etcSay you\u2019re trying to open a British food restaurant in Palo Alto, you\u2019re likely to come up with the narrative: \u201cWe\u2019re the only British food restaurant in PA\u201d\n\nStartups do something similar: They try to differentiate by throwing in buzz words (\u201cWe\u2019re a mobile sharing social app\u201d)Google, who has a monopoly on search, never describes itself as a \u201csearch engine\u201d\n\nThey might, instead, call themselves an \u201cadvertising market\u201d (search advertising is only a small fraction of global advertising)Start small:\n\nAmazon started as an online bookstore\n\neBay first focused on the Beanie Baby market\n\nFacebook first went after Harvard students\n\nIf the market you\u2019re going after is enormous, it likely means there\u2019s tons of competition, and it\u2019s hard to differentiate\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the fourth online pet food company.

That means society considers my problems important and considers me important. It means my problems are okay to have and I\u2019m not in trouble for having them\"Does labeling a person as depressed make people feel better, b/c now they know it's not their fault?\n\nOr does it make ppl depressed about how depressed they are, &amp; then go \u201cThere\u2019s that depression again, guess this means I\u2019m not getting any better\u201d &amp; become depressed about that?If you feel like a burden, know that you can\u2019t always trust your brain\n\nIf System I is broken, you need to call in System II to route around the distorted cognition so you can understand at least intellectually that you\u2019re wrong.\n\nSystem 1 is not the most trustworthy arbiterThe term \"toxic\" is reflexive: \n\nAccusing someone of being something makes it more likely that they turn into that thing\n\nIf you keep accusing your (innocent) partner of being angry &amp; suspicious of you, eventually they'll get tired &amp; become angry &amp; suspicious that something's upImagine Christians suffer a dramatic loss in prestige such that a cross is equivalent to a confederate flag.\n\nThe agreeable Christians suddenly flee, and only the disagreeable diehards are left.\n\n\"See, Christians are dogmatic!\" \n\nThis is what's happened to free speech advocates.Another dynamic:\n\nEvery time we use free speech to justify some unpopular idea, the unpopular idea becomes a little more tolerated,\u00a0&amp; free speech becomes a little less popular\n\nEvery time some group invokes free speech to say controversial stuff, they\u2019re drawing from the commonsHL Mencken once said that \u201cthe trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one\u2019s time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.\u201dThe nightmare scenario is that \u201cfree speech\u201d goes the way of \u201cfamily values\u201d\u2014a seemingly uncontroversial concept gets so tarnished by its association with conservative ideas that it becomes impossible to mention without outing yourself as some kind of far-right weirdo. (Too late)Insisting that others are deliberately trying to hurt you frees you from any obligation to do the hard work of trying to understand other ppl, or the hard work of changing minds, or the hard work of questioning your own beliefs, or or even remembering that we're on the same team.Principle of Charity:\n\nYou should always assume your ideological opponents\u2019 beliefs must make sense from their perspective\n\nIf you can\u2019t even conceive of a position you oppose being tempting to someone, you don\u2019t understand it\n\n\u201cAlmost no one is evil; almost everything is broken\u201dMoloch:\n\nIn any complex multi-person system, the system acts according to its own chaotic incentives that don\u2019t necessarily correspond to what\u00a0any individual within the system wants.\n\nhttps://t.co/l1bQC7pPzPWhy do women too have instincts towards polyamory (and&amp;not just men?)\n\nMayb: \"women genetically \"want\" both to keep an alpha male faithful &amp; to\u00a0capture maximum genetic variation in their offspring.\n\nthus, It's optimal for Jane to have 3 kids by Tarzan &amp; 1 by a romantic stranger.\"Proving too much:\n\nWhen you challenge an argument b/c, in addition to proving its intended conclusion, it also proves false conclusions.\n\nWhen someone says, \"you can't be an atheist b/c you can't disprove God\", respond \"yeah, but you can't disprove Bigfoot. \n\nIt proves too much.You can make diff groups support diff things by changing narrative:\n\ne.g Making Red Tribe support climate change\n\n- Renewable energy is triumph of capitalism\n- Communist China &amp; Russia are threatening our planet &amp; thus U.S. supremacy. They want global warming.\n- You're not racistWhat is the \u201cspirit of the First Amendment\u201d? \n\nBad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Does not get doxxing. Does not get harassment. Does not get fired from job. Gets counterargument. Should not be hard.A good response to an argument is one that addresses an idea; a bad argument is one that silences it\n\nYour success addressing an idea depends on how good the idea is\u2014Your success silencing depends on how powerful you are &amp; how many pitchforks &amp; torches you can get on short noticeIf you want to stress test a censorship system, design one &amp; then hand it over to your worst enemy &amp; let them run it on you.\n\nIf that still gives you the outcome you want, then fine\n\n\"Universalize as if the process you use to universalize would itself become universal.\"If you try to hold the Koch Brothers \u201caccountable\u201d for muddying climate change waters, they'll laugh in your face.\n\nIf you try to hold closeted gay ppl \u201caccountable\u201d for promoting gay rights, it will be very easy &amp; you'll successfully ruin their lives.\n\nDo you want it like this?Lord Byron wrote of his political philosophy:\n\nI wish men to be free\n\nAs much from mobs as kings; from you as me\n\nAll I can say to that is \u2013 it\u2019s a package deal, people. \n\nEither promote good social norms, or be destroyed by the bad ones when the tide turns against you.\u201cThat other monkey has status that should be\u00a0my\u00a0status!\u201d \u2013 nobody ever went broke peddling that.How causes become tribes:\n\n1.

So it\u2019s inevitable that post-modernism itself going to be twisted to support the powerful. (e.g. both cultural Marxists, &amp; far-right media).\"Postmodern meta-epistemology, as I call it, is compatible with rationality (&amp; rationalism, &amp; empiricism).\n\nIt just contends that \u201ctruth\u201d is an unstable concept that depends on a language game to mean, which means there is no ultimate guarantor of what truth per se is.\n\nDisagree\"Assumptions for discussion:\n\n1. Are you trying to present the correct balance btw positions (\u201cjudge mode\u201d) or present 1 side of a case (\u201clawyer mode\u201d)?\n\n2. Do you mean exactly what you say (\u201cthe pointing finger\u201d) or are you groping towards a hard-to-explain concept (\u201cthe moon\u201d)?Assumptions (cont):\n\n3. Are you trying to describe how things work in the real world, or the underlying mechanism beneath them?\n\n4. Are you declaring something is definitely correct (\u201ctheory\u201d), or bringing it to ppl's attention as an idea worthy of consideration (\u201chypothesis\u201d)?Barely even scratching the surface here. There's TONS of stuff I'm not including, across many different disciplines. \n\nGo spend some hours (or years) reading his work:\n\nAs a place to start, I also enjoyed this collection of favorite posts by @alexeyguzey:\n\nhttps://t.co/pzxJangk4V",

Apple would be better w/ a more vulnerable &amp; balanced Jobs.\n\n2/ Maybe building Apple isn't so important anyway.Clearly, if someone is depressed or burned out they're unlikely to build the next Apple.\n\nBut I wonder if we've steered so far in counter-acting the previous grind-it-out culture that we've started to pathologize ambition (e.g. Hustle Porn)Maybe if hustle porn were \"competition porn\"\u2014\n\nBut putting down ppl who work hard &amp; celebrate it is counter productive and against our own interests, since expanding the pie carries society forward.\n\nCompetition can be misdirected hustling, but you can't expand the pie w/o workThe 40 hour work week twitter dilemma sounds silly, but is actually a very important conversation.\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to say \u201clet people do what they want. Don\u2019t judge.\n\nThe real question is: \u201cyeah but what\u2019s the default?\u201d.Status is the mechanism by which society tells people what to do.\n\nSo: What\u2019s higher status? Working harder or working less? What's norm? If someone has to\u2014b/c of our inability to handle nuance at scale\u2014who should feel better, the ppl working 50 hrs or the ppl working 40 hrs?Other questions where setting the default is important. \n\n- Are differences in outcomes due to skill or luck?\n- Is more technology growth (e.g productivity growth) better or not?\n- Should we care more about the overall size of the pie or the distribution?I also wonder whether we're starting to glorify opposite\n\nOur parent's generation never talked about therapy. It was shameful to be sad, or not ambitious\n\nWe've made progress normalizing these things\n\nRelentless ambition isn't everything\u2014it can be at a great cost to self &amp; othersBut have we gone so far that we've not only normalized, but glorified the opposite?\n\nOfc, let ppl be themselves, but back to the Q\u2014what's default?\n\nIs it cooler today to be happy-go-lucky or tortured but deep? Ambitious or balanced? Build or protest? Self-sacrifice or self-care?How would Steve Jobs have been pathologized / diagnosed today? \n\nWould we have encouraged him or discouraged him?\n\nKobe was not for this \"everyone gets a trophy culture\" or work-life harmony (no friends, by his own admission). Don't get me started on Jordan. \n\ne.g Mamba mentality https://t.co/xULXY4aR7pAmbition requires sacrifice. \n\nAre we encouraging people to take sacrifice, or are we discouraging them by diagnosing, pathologizing, or ridiculing them.\n\nOr are we telling them they can have it all, and even if they can't, everyone wins a trophy, because you're all specialSometimes there\u2019s the paradox that ambition might not be great for you in the short term, but good for you long-term.\n\nOr that sometimes it might not even be good for you long-term, but great for the commons.\n\nMost people who've overworked but achieved any success wouldn't trade.What is the state of ambition today?\n\nAre ppl encouraged as much as possible to \"build\"?\n\nIs the next Steve Jobs focused on building Apple today? \n\nIs the next Zuck at Harvard today gonna make the next Facebook? Is that's what's cool?\n\nIs the celebrating of ambition under attack?The world might be better, if, all things equal, ppl were more ambitious (constraining for sustainability)\n\nCore to this is the idea that economic growth (ie expanding the pie) is a good thing\n\nLess growth = less nice things (education, healthcare, etc)\n\nhttps://t.co/fsIhNcaJvFTo me, this is just another example of the great challenge of our time: reconciling meritocracy &amp; egalitarianism\n\nWorking hard shouldn't be a threat to working less, and vice versa, but given that there is competition over which ideas to celebrate to young people, defaults matter",

    "full_text": "Here's another try at articulating Glen Weyl's ideas / quotes: https://t.co/1WwgUcZr5NYou can think of all the social circles that you're a part of in pre modern society\u2014your work circle, your family circle, your friend circle, all these overlap heavily.\n\nSo you're not really an individual b/c there's so many other people who's their circles are the same as yoursAnd then what starts to happen in modernity is these things start to separate out. \n\nSo maybe you only have two people who are in both your work and home circles. \n\nSo then you end up being the unique intersection of all these different like social groups that gives you meaning.So you can then think of yourself as having a mimetic code, which is made up of precisely these quantitative measures of your commitment to these different communities\n\nAnd what makes you unique is the fact that that mimetic code is not the same as anyone else's mimetic code.So we only get to individual humans, like in the modern era. And the way we get to individual humans is not by like removing social structure, but by adding more social structure\n\nWhat actually creates the potential of being an individual is the plurality of human organizations.What's wrong about the libertarian view is that it fails to realize that it's the combination of private property or extreme individualism w/ the fact that we live in a society that's fundamentally social that creates the conditions that the libertarians are objecting to.So anything that tries to strip away community &amp; reveal the true individual is fundamentally confused\n\nOn the contrary, it's by creating a diverse range of communities--and fluid overlapping emergent identities-- that we actually enable people to be individuals in the first placeEconomics tries to do this, but it's confused\n\nWe consume things in a family--most of the things that like make it nice to be in San Francisco or not like features of my individual home, but features of the ambient environment around there that make it desirable to live thereWe are massively overdetermined. Two thirds of income inequality is across country\n\nThere's just like no possible way that we can in this linear way that private goods wants to attribute it back to the individual.Once you move past that, then like the whole edifice that lies behind utilitarian economics based justifications o f  market capitalism goes away, and you start realizing the enormous complexity of the system that we're actually dealing withthe fundamental problem of economics is not how do you reconcile the individual self interest with the common good, the fundamental problem should be, how do we have cooperation under conditions of diversity?selfishness is not even meaningful, b/c given that nearly all of what we consume is consumed in groups, all there really is is either I'm super aligned with you &amp; there's no conflict of interest btw us at all, or we're distant like, really socially distant &amp; thus there's conflictMechanisms like markets that treat symmetrically the interactions btw two people who are very close to each other, &amp; two people are very far from each other will lead to issues b/c they don't actually overcome the key challenge, which is how to live under conditions of difference",

    "full_text": "What is Nietzsche's lasting influence on Nazi Germany?\n\nBrief summary of Stephen Hicks' \"Nietzsche and the Nazis\"\n\nhttps://t.co/rjjukKrhTLIt may be hard to believe that the Nazis thought of themselves as idealists.\n\nWestern liberal democracies\u2014&amp; the freedom, equality, &amp; peace they provide\u2014are seen as good.\n\nBut was it obvious in the 1930s?\n\nDemocratic experiments were tried in ancient Greece and Rome. Both failed.At the time it wasn't obvious liberal democracies were superior. \n\nThe U.S. lasted only 90 years before it plunged into a brutal Civil War. \n\nIn the 1920s the U.S. is itself experiencing economic uncertainty and is shortly to plunge into its Great Depression.Nazism is collectivistic: it does not hold that individuals have their own lives to live and happiness to pursue. Rather, individuals should serve the general good, to which they subordinate their personal lives\n\nNazism tried to reconcile nationalism and socialism.the Nazis rejected cosmopolitanism, an ideal of Western liberals who believe that all humans are essentially the same wherever one travels in the world, and who believe that one should strive to be a citizen of the world. \n\nThe Nazis are nationalists, by contrast.The message was quite clear: You are not a private individual seeking profit or higher wages in a capitalist economy. You and your property belong in trust to the German people, and you have a duty to serve the public interest, even if it involves a personal sacrifice.That human beings are divided into collective groups that shape their identity. \n\nThat those collective groups are in a life and death competitive struggle with each other. \n\nThat any tactic is legitimate in the war of competing groups.That human beings are not individuals with their own lives to live but are servants of the state. \n\nThat the state should have total power over both the minds and bodies of its citizens and may dispose of them asIf you believe wholeheartedly and passionately that your identity is found by merging yourself with your group\u2014* that your group is locked in a mortal, zero-sum conflict w/ other groups\u2014&amp; that reason is superficial &amp; that passion &amp; instinct drive the world\u2014what does that portend?Thinkers associated w/ revolutions:\n\nCommunist in Russia &amp; China - Marx\nFrench - Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nAmerican - John Locke\nNazi - Hegel, Fichte, some Marx, but mostly Nietzsche.Friedrich Nietzsche was a nineteenth-century German philosopher famous for his worship of human potential &amp; for encouraging individuals to seek great heights &amp; make real their creative dreams. He is also famous for his absolute loathing of all things small, cowardly, or mediocre.For fans of Nietzsche, the idea that God is dead galvanizes every fiber of their being. They respond by feeling, both passionately &amp; solemnly: I will become the author. I will create. I will embrace the responsibility\u2014joyously. I will move beyond good and evil &amp; create new valuesBoth religion and socialism thus glorify weakness and need. \n\nBoth recoil from the world as it is: tough, unequal, harsh. \n\nBoth flee to an imaginary future realm where they can feel safe. \n\nAnd both desperately seek someone to look after them\u2014whether it be God or the State.And where, asks Nietzsche, are the men of courage? Who is willing to stare into the abyss? Who can look a tiger in the eye without flinching? Every generation produces its   people who accept easily that life is brutal, but assert their strength to meet the challenge.The more we look at history, the more we are struck by the diversity of circumstances &amp; how dramatically beliefs about values have changed across time. \n\nWe once prized power &amp; looked down upon the humble and &amp; meek. Now the meek are the \u201cgood guys\u201d while the aggressive are \u201cevilWe went from: \n\n- Be ambitious and bold, and seek your highest dream.\n- Seek great challenges, pleasures, &amp; go your own way in life\n- And when you accomplish something great, admire yourself for what you have done and indulge yourself in the rewards that greatness deserves.To: \n\n- The meek shall inherit the earth, and blessed are the poor. \n- Instead of seeking profit, one should sacrifice and give to charity. \n- Be aware of one\u2019s weaknesses and sins, and be ashamed and self-deprecating as a result.This has led to rise in Democracy. \n\nDemocracies tailor their policies to the majority\u2014not to the exceptional few who are radicals, trailblazers, and uncompromising risk-takers. But according to Nietzsche, the modern democracy itself based on this great inversion described above.Nietzsche also credits the Judeo-Christian tradition for its spiritual development\u2014its ability to focus inward &amp; stress self-discipline.\n\nHe wants to combine the physical vitality of the aristocratic masters w/ the spiritual ruthlessness of Christianity.\n\nCeasar w/ soul of ChristNietzsche holds that reason is an artificial tool of weaklings\u2014those who need to feel safe and secure build fantasy orderly structures for themselves. \n\nInstead, instincts are the deepest parts of your nature\u2014and when you feel them strongly, nurture them and manifest them.Nietzsche views on Jews are often misappropriated.\n\nHe did blame them (&amp; Christians) for the great inversion valuing the weak over the strong, subverting greatness in his view\n\nHe still admires how well they've both prospered despite this and flourished amid the great inversion.Differences between Nietzsche and the Nazis: \n\n1.\u00a0 Nietzsche did not believe any race was superior. \n2. Nietzsche did not think Germans were culturally superior.\n3.\u00a0Nietzsche wasn't Anti-Semitic . \n4. Nietzsche saw strong parallels between Judaism and ChristianitySimilarities between Nietzsche &amp; the Nazis: \n\n1. Both were strongly collectivistic\n2. Both saw see zero-sum conflict as inescapable and as fundamental to the human condition. \n3. Both downplay reason &amp; prize instincts\n4. Both are anti-democratic, anti capitalistic, &amp; anti-liberalThe Nazis stood for collectivism. The opposite of that is a philosophy of individualism that recognizes individual rights.\n\nThe Nazis stood for instinct as one\u2019s basic guides in life. The opposite of that is a philosophy that has a healthy confidence in the power of reason.After detailing the atrocities of the Nazis as well as the underlying philosophies of the Nazi party (and contrasting them with Nietzsche's philosophies), Hicks ends the book provocatively:\n\n\"The Nazis knew what they stood for. Do we?\"",

    "full_text": "Book notes from Thomas Piketty's \"Capital in the 21st Century\" \ud83d\udc47\n\nCurious to hear critiques &amp; responses to the book.\n\nhttps://t.co/v6E6Zw9SjCNormal economic growth has been between 1-1.5% annually.\n\nWhen it's higher than that it's for 3 reasons:\n\n1- high population growth\n2- temporary bubbles\n3- \"catch up growth\" (e.g. Germany &amp; Japan after WWII)Piketty's main focus is the growing inequality between capital &amp; labor.\n\nA rentier is a person who lives off the interest on savings instead of working (e.g trust-fund kids, landlords)\n\nInequality grows when r &gt; g \u2013 the rate of return from capital is greater than the growth rate.Laborers largely live pay-check to pay-check. So their income grows at the level of GDP per capita.\n\nRentiers live of interest of their principal, so their income largely grows on rate of return on capital (one check on this is pop growth)\n\nhttps://t.co/csGldkILhrWhen the rate of return on capital exceeds the growth rate of the economy (as it did through much of history until the 19th century and as is likely to be the case again in the 21st century), then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income.In normal times, the rate of return on capital averages about 4% \u2013 5% per year, and the GDP per capita growth rate averages about 1% to 1.5% per year. \n\nSo in normal times, rentiers\u2019 yearly incomes should be growing more than laborers\u2019, which would increase inequalityDuring wars &amp; crises however, rentiers are worse off than laborers relatively. \n\nHyper inflation, asset destruction, gov't interference, wealth taxes, are all likely to hit rentiers the hardest. 1914-1945 was an example of this.Piketty references Jane Austen novels which show how much time money matters take up. \n\nEven with someone who has 5x average income, it was necessary to spend most of one\u2019s time attending to the needs of daily life.\n\nGrateful for economic growth that has changed that for many.Contrary to the popular consensus today, the American Dream was very real for most of America\u2019s history. \n\nThis was due to the fact that America (as a new country) had less time to accumulate a rentier class, which takes a couple generations for the fortunes to really multiply.Rentier class used to be top 1%. Now it's top 0.1%. Why?\n\n- Have a bunch of super laborers who make money both on labor &amp; on their principal (e.g CEOs). Fewer rich bums these days. :)\n\n- Capital is disproportionately tied up in institutions (endowments, sovereign wealth funds)There's growing income in equality among labor. The share of top 10% (top 1% in particular) has been growing for decades.\n\nCEO salary has been rising steadily. Why?\n\n- Maybe it's just the market\n- Maybe it's low taxes relative to 1980s\n- Maybe it's corporate governanceThe Rich get richer faster than others.\n\nPeople like Bill Gates grow their fortune at 8-10% a year, double Piketty's 4-5% return on capital.\n\nThe richest endowments grow at 10% yearly as well. Medium rich endowments grow at 7-8%. Avg person saving for retirement is 4-5%.All of this suggests increasing global inequality. \n\nWhich is why Piketty suggests a global tax on wealth.\n\nMaybe fixing housing would help here, as that transfers wealth from laborers to rentiers.\n\nOr fixing colleges, which also puts laborers in debt.\n\nOr increasing birth rates.Personally, I am more excited about fixing wealth inequality by enabling people to have equity in companies (perhaps by a token-like mechanism), such that people are directly and legibly aligned with economic growth.\n\nShare the pie as you expand it.\n\nhttps://t.co/XqywrvtVlaThis was a great book review that inspired these notes as well: https://t.co/guKzjQcn1l",

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways from Albert Wenger's \n\"World After Capital\" &amp; interviews.\n\nRead the real thing here: https://t.co/cpkbZWRcQWWhat does it mean to be human today?\n\nEmotions, consciousness, sure, but ultimately it's the ability to contribute to the knowledge loop (learn, create, share).\n\nThe idea that I can read a book or see a piece of art that someone else wrote in a different place and time period.When AI can contribute to knowledge loop\u2014what makes humans special then?\n\nQualia: when I look at this orange chair over there, I have a feeling of what it feels like to be looking at an orange chair\n\nWe get the brain at constituent level, but not emergent phenomena level.Every age of humanity has a defining scarcity.\n\nHumanity then invents tech that shifts that scarcity.\n\nAgriculture solved for food, scarcity shifted to arable land\n\nEnlightenment gave us industrial age, scarcity shifted from land to capital\n\nScarcity in knowledge age is attentionChange from forager to agrarian:\n\nMigratory -&gt; sedentary\nPolygamous -&gt; monogamous\nFlat societies -&gt; hierarchical\nAnimistic religions -&gt; god religions\n\nChange from agrarian to industrial:\n\nCountry -&gt; city\nLarge families -&gt; nuclear families\nCommons -&gt; private propertyThe need for food didn't go away. We just filled it in more efficient ways.\n\nSame thing for capital. It's not like we no longer need to build houses and cars and so forth. It's just that we can build sufficient housing and cars for everybody overtime.Fire can be used to cook, but it can be used to burn down. \n\nAI can be used to diagnose disease, but it can also manipulate people.\n\nAgriculture made Athenian democracy possible, but also dark ages.\n\nIndustrial society made democracy possible, but it also made Stalin possible.Digital machines are different from industrial machines in two ways:\n\nZero Marginal Cost &amp; Universality.\n\nEconomics wasn't built on zero marginal cost, a lot of theories break down. \n\nThe constraint in the last one was capital, this one is attention.Ppl used to have a clear path: go to college, get a job, have a long standing career, have a place nicer than parents.\n\nNo longer. We don't yet have a replacement path for people wanting predictability/stability.  MAGA is evidence.\n\nNeed fundamental shifts, not just incremental.Capitalism it does an amazing job at turning financial capital into physical capital, which is why we have all these extraordinary capabilities\n\nOf course, many people are still poor, albeit less. But as a society, we have enough to feed people. It's a distribution problem.Capitalism works well when you can have markets that can have prices. \n\nBut what is the price for you to discover your purpose in life? \n\nNo market mechanism will solve that. \n\nThat's an attention problem that we need to allocate attention to without a market mechanism.Collective action problems:\n\nWhat is the prize for humanity being able to deflect an incoming asteroid detected? (Or prepare for a possible pandemic?) \n\nThere is no market mechanism that will allocate collective attention to this problem.Solutions to our problems need to come from knowledge age paradigm, not industrial age.\n\nGov't providing job - industrial age\n\nGov't providing UBI - knowledge age\n\nWhat will people do instead of jobs?\n\nResearch\nSelf-care\nFamily/friends\nEnvironment\nMake art\nCultivate knowledgeRole of capital in knowledge age?\n\nin 1780, ~80% of human attention in the US was dedicated just to feeding ourselves. Today, that's like sub 5%,.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of human attention is on economic activity. Capital will still have a role, but maybe we can shift it to ~20%.Types of freedoms\n\nEconomic - ~UBI of $800 a month will let ppl get out of job loop\n\nInformational - Data sovereignty \n\nPsychological freedom - no longer being slaves to whatever stimuli are thrown at us.Network effects are too strong -- they have turned normal distributions into power laws\n\nHard q's:\n\nWhat's the right governance for those networks? \n\nWhat is the power that I should have as a participant in those networks relative to the owners and operators of the network?\"shift the balance of power back towards or some of it anyhow, back to the edge, we need to figure out how to give each and every one of us computers that we control, and that lets us interact with the other systems through computation that we control ourselves. \"Everything should be an API.\n\nI shouldn't have to ask Facebook or Twitter for permission to program Facebook or Twitter, I should just be able to do it.\n\nEverything is programmable, everything is composable, everything is remixable.e.g. If Amazon had it...I could have powerful bots operated on my behalf scanning Amazon, comparing Amazon to three other sites automatically, it would give startup sites a real opportunity b/c machines could check 2nd sites on my behalf.",

We belong to groups, tribes, nations, etc.Liberalism is predicated on the assumption that we have powerful abilities to reason, but we cannot reach universal agreement on the big Q's about life. We go to war over these disagreements\n\nSo, liberalism privileges individual rights as to help us collaborate when no one agreesLiberalism has evolved over time.\n\nInitially the emphasis was mainly on \"negative rights\" (free speech, due process).\n\nThen it evolved to \"positive rights\" (e.g. equality)\n\nNegative rights are positive sum, positive rights not so much.\n\nMore context: https://t.co/kig6uUPlfWTenets of nationalism:\n\n- You're born into a social group called a nation.\n- Each nation should have its own state.\n- Each state should have its own sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nNationalism is more powerful than civilizations.\n\nThere used to be broader empires, but no more.Many Americans misunderstand the pull of nationalism, and might dismiss the description of it as inherent in people. \n\nSince we're a liberal state and the liberal ideology is so deeply baked into our DNA, we gravitate to thinking about liberalism above all else.Tension between liberalism &amp; nationalism:\n\n(Progressive) Liberalism is about universalism. Everyone has the same rights. That value system is the only thing that's not diverse about liberalism's aims.\n\nNationalism is about sovereignty. This is our people, our land, our rules, etcThis leads liberalism to want to spread universally, as that is the best way to operate.\n\nThis ruffles nationalists who want sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nLiberalism praise rights and universalism above all.

The \"connected\" comes from the utility YC providesThe filter is acceptance rate.\n\n1% means much more than 5% in terms of valuing YC's talent rating.\n\nUtility is how much more valuable the startup is bc of the program. e.g Bigger network = bigger chance of success\n\nFilter is pre-program. Utility is post\n\nSignal = Filter + UtilityThere's more to signal than filter\n\nThiel Fellowship (TF) has higher filter than YC\n\nBut many would choose YC b/c it has higher utility\n\n- more legible to investors, hires, &amp; your parents\n- more alumni you can sell to or raise from\n\nFor utility, quantity has a quality all its ownCuration businesses need to align filter w/ utility\n\nUtility pulls you in the direction of expanding size.

Today that number is more like 88%. This is the decline people are worrying about when they talk about technological unemployment or any other threat to work, and it seems to be happening across the Western world\" https://t.co/zU0tA1caFaWhat happened to the million working-age men who are not in the workforce? Lots of unsatisfactory explanations.\n\nMaybe it's the more miserable your work is, and the more decent options you have available to you (in terms of gov't support), the more likely you are to leave work.Manufacturing has seen a big decline\n\n\"The people getting kicked out of manufacturing jobs may have other jobs available to them, but those jobs may not be as good or pay as well. This isn\u2019t 'technological unemployment'. But it might be technological underemployment.\" https://t.co/iOrqv1s2IdAutomation hits the middle class jobs first.\n\nThe highest-paying jobs are doing fine. The lowest-paying jobs are also doing fine.\n\nIt's the middle class jobs that are in trouble (e.g manufacturing, administrative positions)\n\nSo when they get automated, they get lower paying jobs.This makes sense intuitively.\n\nMachines can't be CEOS. They also can't deliver pizza or do personal care.\n\nBut they can proofread, translate, drive trucks, etc.But why is this worse now when progress has happened forever?\n\nA combination of factors: \n\n\"Today's robots are better than yesterday's Rolexes\"\n\nOur education system has been worse at adapting &amp; retraining ppl\n\nWe haven't had enough technological progress.\nhttps://t.co/ZOyXKidiiUConclusion:\n\nNo evidence of tech unemployment, but there might be potential underemployment (robots taking middle-skill jobs &amp; pushing people into lower-skill jobs, or out of labor force entirely)\n\nUsually there is an adjustment, but it takes time (&amp; better gov't and ed policy).",

And if victimhood is a virtue, privilege is a vice. It has the same relationship to victimhood that cowardice does to honor. Checking one's privilege is analogous to the shaming of cowards that we see in honor cultures.Disclaimers: \n\n\"To say that being recognized as a victim raises one\u2019s moral status does not imply that any particular victim is cynically taking advantage of this fact. It does not imply that any particular victim sought out or enjoys whatever status victimhood conveys.\"It does not imply that this status outweighs other disadvantages they might have. And it does not imply that anyone\u2019s grievances are illegitimate or that those who point out their marginality are dishonest.\"\n\nAlso there are no judgments between the terms honor, dignity, &amp; victimExplaining their work:\n\n\"Many who showcase their disadvantage are factually correct about their situation, but it's still of sociological interest that they'd advertise it in this fashion, when in other settings they might hide such things or at least not emphasize them.\"In victimhood culture, the main way to gain status is not just to be a victim, but to stand up for other victims. And so even if you're not in a victim class, you can gain status by aggressively defending those who are marginalized\n\noverlap w/ christianity:https://t.co/hL9dD37hk2In a dignity culture, both force (honor culture) appealing to authority (victimhood culture) are looked down upon\n\nIn honor cultures, being harmed or oppressed can be a source of shame\n\nIn victim culture, we defer to those who have been hurt.Honor culture emerges in places where having a reputation for toughness is valuable for survival.\n\nHonor culture subsided in places that had effective law enforcement and in places where people could achieve commercial independence.\n\nhttps://t.co/Kx5l73AvFhVictim culture hares honor culture\u2019s awareness of offense, but responds w/ appealing to authority instead of direct aggression.  \n\nIt maintains dignity culture\u2019s reliance on 3rd parties to resolve conflict, but dispenses w/ its default to ignore slights or negotiate first.What leads to victimhood culture?\n\nThe presence and power of social superiors in many aspects of our lives makes reliance on third parties increasingly attractive.\n\nCombined with a shortage of strong ties and a surfeit of weak ones, it makes public complaint increasingly likely.Also generational differences in childhood with those growing up in recent decades experiencing drastically higher degrees of adult supervision, regulation, and protection\n\nThis happens partly because of greater involvement in school and other adult-supervised activities.Minorities have often resented slights by the majority, but appealing to authority wasn't feasible\n\nWe've had extreme reliance on third parties in totalitarian states, but little concern w/ equality\n\nThis is perhaps why victimhood culture hadn't emerged as strong in the past.",

Environments are like cheat codes\n\nIf you can surround yourself with builders, you will have a higher chance of becoming a builder\n\nThe physical environment that you are in, can affect your motivation, effort, and successKick off the positive feedback loop which gets you innately curious &amp; willing to explore your interests\n\ne.g Schwarzenegger only got started down his path after going to a gym in Austria where he won a weightlifting trophy\n\nThat positive feedback propelled him on his path in lifeA lot of what drives curiosity is you ppl like it\u2019s okay to go explore a particular direction (b/c of feedback)\n\nThe world needs more people who follow their curiosity\n\nBut there\u2019s a shortage of positive feedback today, thus reducing the # of ppl who explore their curiositiesNutrition, Exercise, Sleep, etc:\n\nSelf-experimentation is more important than the results\n\nThe point \u2013 Don\u2019t wake up at 5 AM because so and so Twitter guru also wakes up at that time, do what works for youUltimate feedback loop\u2013\u201cAm I doing things that seem good to the local circle of ppl whose opinions I care about?\u201d\n\nWhat ppl think about you, especially the ppl you respect, is a very important signal as to whether you're on the right path. &amp; it has a long-standing tribal historyBe focused, but also embrace 10-20% serendipity\n\nHave your own iPhone moment: Focus on doing something that may not seem intuitive, that may not align with the metrics you\u2019re collecting, and that may seem a little crazy, but has the potential of really changing your lifeThe best leaders are innately\u00a0interested in the lives/problems of the people they lead \u2013 they have a deep sense of empathy\n\nBy learning about the personal stories of those you lead, you\u2019re better able to design an environment that works well for themInformation diet may actually drive your food diet, and it may be more important.\n\nFiction books inject, at a much deeper level, information about how the world worksHumans walk around with a basic firewall up to a lot of the information we\u2019re exposed to\n\nBut for a select few ppl (our tribe &amp; those we look up to) \u2013 that firewall gets dimmed\n\nSo to change the way you think, surround yourself with ppl you want to be like.If you want to poach someone, try it when they come back from vacation\n\nOften when people come back to work from a vacation, their minds are much more open to other job alternatives\n\nThis is also why companies have offsites: new environments open our minds up to new possibilitiesHappiness to me is flow + knowing you moved the needle of the planet.I think it\u2019s the struggle that really makes you successful as a company, whereas if you have the curse of plenty very early on, it\u2019s really hard to develop that right organizational muscle in order to be successfulIn the venture world, funds compete for a limited amount of deals so there isn\u2019t much cooperation (zero-sum game)\n\nBut in hedge fund deals, people work together and even have company off-sites with other firms (positive sum game)\n\nPlay infinite games.Religion should be respected even if you don\u2019t believe in it because it's still here after so many years\n\nReligion strengthens tribal bonds. It connects people who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily connect with one another\n\nHow can we create a new religion to encourage people to work together?It's criminal that we ask teenagers to wake up at 6:45\n\nAdults want to wake up early, but children do not. I think school should start at 11 o\u2019clock. That alone may change the world.\n\nStudies have shown that children need to wake up later than adultsIt is really important to make feedback a positive experience for other people because if you don\u2019t, they won\u2019t give you any.\n\nYou want the critical feedback because you want data on how to be better.We view it as a pejorative that someone will play The Sims or Fortnight for many hrs\n\nBut what you're doing is solving resource allocation problems. You're literally doing the same thing a McKinsey analyst does, for fun\n\nAnd yet your parents are angry at you. That's interestingCould you possibly bring that same nuclear energy of productivity into other realms into software in general?\n\nYou should not be stymied by your mood. software should enable you to jump &amp; punch above your weight &amp; current mood and it should use all these psychological techniquesOne of the most powerful game mechanics: Leaderboard\n\nBecause a leaderboard is merely digitizing what we do all the time. So when you sit down to at say a dinner party and you meet a bunch of new people. You're basically assessing who's good who's bad who's interesting who's notBe careful what you measure though.\n\nCrossFit, for example, optimizes like for you to do as many reps as possible.\n\nYou can always accomplish more reps by breaking form and by hurting yourself.\n\nSo people get injured as an emergent property of the systemAnother important game mechanic is injecting randomness into things. \n\nThis is why humans play the lottery over and over is because of the random nature of it. They can't model itPpl say you should be contrarian &amp; not care what others think about you. \n\nIt's not clear to me that that is true b/c what other people think about you, at least what the ppl you respect think about you, is a very important signal as to whether you're doing the right thing or notWhat the people you respect think about you is actually really important training data because that gives you a sense of where you stand in the world.\n\nAnd I'm not talking about the masses or Twitter.\n\nI'm talking about the 15 ppl that are influential to you, that you care about.Pull vs Push mode of talent sourcing:\n\nInitially it was like, let's find unrepresented talent globally and it turns out the way you find them is you by actually building a thing for them to play where the act of playing makes them better &amp; then you see who are the best players?The world where we're in today is there's a shortage of positive feedback, especially positive feedback to the right people. \n\nIt is scary to read stories of how great ppl got their break when someone gave positive feedback to another person, e.g an email from someone you admiredThe goal is to get people stuck in a positive feedback loop, rapidly iterating in the positive feedback loop, making a lot of progress and reaching a point where that positive feedback loop doesn't plateau and then hopefully repeating that process over and over again.These are fun studies where people move to different zip codes and their weight always fluctuates in the same direction. If you want to lose weight the simplest thing you can do is to move from SF to NYC. Everyone else is working out and eating healthy and you'll do the same.Willpower is overrated.\n\nYour environment is a one-time CapEx expense on your willpower. You do it once. You fly to a place, start working in a company or go to a campus or make this new friend. And then it just yields dividends.People are often interested in specifics like: what time do you wake up? What do you eat? What's your workout regimen? \n\nThat's is actually the wrong message to send bc I can tell you what time I wake up, but what's more important is the fact that I'm obsessed about optimizing itThe takeaway that I think more people should be in the business of self-experimentation is actually more important than the results because the time that I wake up is pretty individualized to me think a lot of happen to todayHow's work going? People have a cached answer to that.\n\nSo they're doing mental substitution: \"Well, how was today?\"\n\nSo if you want to get someone to quit their job find them on a bad day and ask them that Q....suddenly they start telling themselves work isn't great isn't it?Most major career decisions are made on moments of vacation b/c you come back to work and what happens is not necessarily work is good or bad but you're flooded with  work, which is not as fun as vacation. That catalyzes you to go out and look for another job.Viewing ppl as emerging properties of underlying systems:\n\nInstead of saying that person's good or bad, look what cause that person to do X or Y.\n\nThen you can decode people, predict them better, which means you can interact w/ them better &amp; create new structures to manifest thatWhat separates I think successful &amp; unsuccessful people is these Loops that they get stuck in and I think the most important interventions basically change the loop and certainly that's what we're trying to do at scale.There's a lot to be learned from that in terms of setting up a positive feedback loop for yourself. \n\nFall in love with what you do so that you get to work on what you loveBenefits to impacting people younger:\n\nI mean it seems like as you age you basically trade novelty for pattern recognition and the brain is much more plastic and malleable when you have less dated a pattern recognizer on so shaping someone's life early on in life.on CRISPR:\n\nWe don't understand the computer, so why edit the source codeStart small:\n\nThere's these amazing interviews with with Mark Zuckerberg in 2005 where he says, yeah, our goal is to really be a good director at Harvard and maybe other few universities.Why people don't talk to users:\n\nThere's a psychological software bug in your brain where it is more satisfying to build the thing than to show the thing to users.\n\nMaybe b/c it predicts there will be more flow in working on the things as opposed to showing it to ppl.the twist on this is you shouldn't do exactly what your users tell you to do but you should engage with them a lot. You want to engage with them and figure out what the underlying problem is. File it as input, but don't necessarily react to every single feature request.Advice on advice:\n\nif you want to become a good advice giver - you want to figure out who are you in life a real influencer for -- the people for whom you have write access to their brain -- such that you can give them advice literally no one else can give, and they will listen.You don't want to overly rely on metrics. e.g. Google got to the point where it was A/B Testing shades of blue. \n\nYou don't get the iPhone that way.\n\nPersonal iPhone moment: Do something that may seem crazy &amp; may not align w/ the data but has the potential of changing your lifeAvoid a sort of innovator's dilemma:\n\nIn order to reinvent yourself, you need to both cannibalize existing business models and certainly redirect resources in a way that doesn't immediately kill your core biz.\n\nGoogle model better for incremental innovation, Apple for disruptive.On having sufficient struggle:\n\nGoogle and Facebook's culture really stuck a toothpick into the sand and had a massive oil will come gushing out.\n\nHard for them to have same sense of urgency as, say, Amazon that had to struggle for a long time to succeed or Apple that almost diedPlaying the game of life in third person as opposed to first is important b/c you're going to have good &amp; bad days you're going to be sitting at some point in a 1-1 w/ someone &amp; it's going to be a bad day &amp; they're going to deliver bad news &amp; you're going to need to react wellAs a manager &amp; as a leader you want to design the best game that both aligns company incentives &amp; employees desires &amp; the real way to understand people is kind of through this deeper substrate level where you actually become a genuinely interested in them &amp; their lives &amp; storiesRead fiction while you're young:\n\nif you're a disagreeable rational person you have this mindset where you're constantly judging &amp; thinking 'well is that true' fiction right below that enters your psyche at a deeper level &amp; helps you develop more models about how the world works",

By the time you're 35, you're tired. Novelty wears off. Time to commitAnd in some emerging markets, it's changed dating norms completely: \n\nIn some countries where  women who aren't even allowed to go out by themselves are able to get access to thousands of potential dates (not just their inner circle), and decline them with no social/physical riskOnline dating market is huge from business POV:\n\nSome people are like, Well, every time it works, you get out of the app. And I'm like, Yeah, but how many relationships work and how many new people come into the pool every day? And how many people are not on online dating yet?In fact, the fastest growing cohort online dating right now is 50+ yrs old\n\nThey're going to get to a point where it's going to get a lot more efficient around &amp; and I also think it's going to serve you up opportunities: here's a good date idea, here's a ticket, here's an event.There will also be apps that continue on with you after the first date, acting as sort of a concierge or relationship coach (e.g. https://t.co/HueoHGGmEJ)over time, you're going to be able to put an astonishing level of specificity into what you're looking for.\n\n\"people get mad about this but these apps are going to match people on every possible parameter, period.\"Online dating has also impacted match-making. \n\nif you introduce one of your friends to another friend, they start dating, it turns out poorly. That's bad for the social group\n\nAnd historically, that was a risky, but positively skewed bet, b/c you could form alliances. But now...Because there's so many dates available, and the overall relationship success rate is down because the opportunity cost is zero, people are not doing introductions anymore, because there's only that downside skew (this isn't the case professionally)If you want to go much much deeper, read this: https://t.co/3Jwmgxaae4",

All illiquid.\n\nOver last decade, all of these have performed well for the most part, which has grown their PE allocations perhaps double where they want to be.Also, there's been a huge expansion in people starting VC/PE funds, raising more money &amp; on quicker time scales.\n\nMore funds getting bigger raising faster.\n\nThe top players in the asset class has been performing, so they've gotten away with it, even though LPs were over-allocatedSo, imagine in a recession where stock market drops significantly.\n\nLiquid part of the portfolio shrinks.\n\nIlliquid part of the portfolio rises accordingly.\n\nThe illiquid part was too big to begin with!\n\nAnd since liquid part down, that means PE valuations drop too.So the illiquid part isn't going to have the returns they\u00a0thought.\n\nBut the marks on illiquid assets arrive a lot later than public stock\u00a0prices.\n\nSo now they're significantly more allocated to the alternative assets portion of their portfolio (PE/VC)\n\nWhat do they do?Rebalance their portfolios.\n\nSo it looks like less PE/VC as a result.\n\nAnd these are the endowments, the professional LPs.\n\nWhat about the new LPs, who bought in at the top into new funds with no track records?\n\nYep.

And the ideal length for a novel is 194 pages.\"Publishing industry made following errors:\n\n1/ Ad-based business model\n\n2/ Quantity over quality \n\nSimply transposing current model to subscription won't work en masse b/c people don't want 30 subscriptions.\n\nThe only solution is unbundling individual pieces from the magazine.Just like music has unbundled \"the single\", publishing too should unbundle \"the article\".\n\nPublishers are hesitant about this b/c then the stars will have more leverage over them. \n\nRight now the stars stay b/c they think they need the publishers.But soon it'll become apparent who's carrying the weight, and who's just dead weight. \n\nReaders want this\u2014they want to bond w/ writers more so than publishers.\n\nTechnology will enable individual writers to have the tools &amp; back-office only previously accessible to publicationsA top journalist at a publication creates more value than they capture, &amp; so they'll break off\n\nMany publications will suffer &amp; even disappear b/c they aren't bringing enough value relative to the value they capture, &amp; some of that value will become value will become commoditizedIn conclusion: In the future, readers will be able to directly pay writers for their work without any middleman.\n\nAlready seeing this happen with Substack\n\nThis will enable writers to charge a lot more for individual pieces.Quality writing is the most under-valued and under-priced form of creative work today\n\nThe best journalists earn $5-10 per word, or a few thousand dollars for a week\u2019s worth of work, which is quite low when you compare it to the pay of top creatives in the music &amp; art industriesOnly $5?\n\nFor writing that could teach you something useful about life, even make you a better person?\n\nWe don't even want to pay more for a piece than we pay for the coffee we drink while reading it.There might be 10,000 writers in the world who can command a following of between 10,000 &amp; 100,000 people of whom a significant number would be happy to pay one to $5 per piece.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that, in the future, there\u2019ll be a one-person media company worth $1 billion+You have to differentiate btw 2 kinds of writing: one which is being weaponized to trick people into clicking on pre roll ads. And the other which conforms to the traditional definition of writing worth reading\u2014&amp; paying for. Clickbait should be free\u2014they should pay you to read itOn reading: If a piece doesn't start well, then the chances are vanishingly small that it'll improve later\n\nSo, if you're faced with a really bad first paragraph, give it up. It's not worth your time to go deeper into it\n\nAlso only read things that'll be relevant years from nowOther reading tips:\n\n- When viewing a publication, it\u2019s important to examine their business model (be careful of websites that make money by keeping you addicted to their site)\n\n- If a book can be summarized, it shouldn\u2019t be a book.Global publications will gain more readers as translation technology advances.\u00a0\n\nEventually, translation tech will reach a point where people will be able to read an article and not tell which language it was originally written\u00a0in.\n\nWe'll have airpods translating instantaneously.Audiobook sales will overtake ebooks\n\nOne thing facilitating this: The massive popularization of wireless Bluetooth headphones\n\nWith audiobooks, authors are able to convey more emotion, include bonus content, &amp; add background music, all of which can\u2019t be done through static textLong audio: When we get really good machine summarization, then the most efficient imaginable use of your time for consume consuming information is to have summaries delivered to you as audio while you're doing something else.Kindle wasn't super disruptive\u2014about as much as paperback books, but not movable type.\n\nOur basic idea of what a book is our basic idea of who writes a book, what you get from a book, what the economic model of a book is, those things have remained intactCheck out &amp; subscribe to The Browser (https://t.co/UAHdBziII2)\u2014writing worth reading.

Management gives you leverage.\n\nOptimizing managing process can have ripple effects in your company.\n\nManagers dictate most of people's experiences at companies.They effectively oversee the social contract btw the company &amp; employee.\n\nIf employee's have a bad experience w/ their manager, they'll likely leave.\n\nManagers are so important Keith Rabois suggests optimizing for your manager as much as the specific company.Good management matters more than ever:\n\nAndy Grove wrote High Output for industrial, conveyor belt era\n\nToday, employees don't just need to be productive, they need to be creative\n\nWhich means they need to be inspired &amp; internally motivated so they can be generative &amp; productiveGreat ICs are expected to become managers, even if they have neither the skillset nor the interest. But being a good IC doesn't make you a good manager.\n\nLet IC's be IC's if they want, &amp; create paths for ppl to be managers.  \n\nPeople aren't born managers. They need to be trained.Onboarding:\n\n- The best indicator of how long someone will stay in the org is their experience in the first day.\n\n- Make sure everything's set up so they can ship something their first day.\n\n- Make sure they can easily understand priorities of the company and where they fit in.How to have a 1:1\n\n- Weekly 30 min 1:1 with your reports\n\n- Update &amp; agenda prepped in advance by the reports\n\n- Align on what are the top three things that are most important to get done by this time next week. Capture those &amp; check in next week:\n\nQ's: https://t.co/kHzetBf0m5Goal setting:\n\nOften problems come up that seem like they're communication problems, but really they're planning problems.\n\nDifferent ways to do goals (e.g OKRs) just make sure they're clear and transparent for everyone across teams to see.Performance Reviews:\n\n- Decouple performance review from compensation bonus (do that before the review)\n\n- The goal is no surprises\n\n- It's a way to retain people, renew commitments, and reset expectations if needed.Feedback:\n\n- Be direct, clear, &amp; concise. Give it during regular 1:1s. \n\n- Make sure you ask for it too, and make it a good experience for the feedback giver or else they won't give it.\n\n- You're looking for people to take ownership &amp; show growth-mindset when taking feedback.Conflict resolution:\n\nWhen people hate each other it's usually because they're not hearing each other.\n\nIf you can get them essentially repeating back what the other person is saying, you'd be surprised at how conflicts can evaporate.\n\nRead NVC: https://t.co/ynIAWSPSW5How to run group meetings well:\n\n- Make sure people are prepped ahead of time (updates published ahead)\n\n- Having a meeting owner to move ppl along\n\n- Also have a note-taker to track decisions &amp; next steps\n\n- Don't create weird incentives where ppl get promoted b/c of face-timeComp:\n\n- More important to figure out what's fair within org than in market, as that's what ppl care more about.\n\n- Different approaches: Uber famously paid 75% of market as a gut check \"How much do you believe this\"? Netflix famously pays aggressive salaries but skimps on equityPerformance Improvement Plan:\n\n- PIPs are opportunities for struggling employees to reinvent themselves.\n\n- \"These were expectations for the role. This is observed performance. This is what we need to do to bridge the gap.\"\n\n- PIPs need to be specific. Not \"Improve communication\"Firing well:\n\n- Fire crisply &amp; kindly\n\n- Don't negotiate\n\n- Don't have long transition periods. Cut the chord.\n\n- Don't demote (usually)\n\n- Don't feel too terrible. You're letting them go to a different company where they will be more valued, more respected, and more successfulMistake founders make:\n\nHero'ing: doing the work themselves on behalf of their reports. \n\nThis is bad because you start resenting your team and because they develop a learned helplessness.\n\nIf you have to do it, acknowledge explicitly you're doing it so it's known it's temporary.Culture:\n\nSolves the resolution to bandwidth problem.\n\nYou can't be involved in every decision as the company grows, so you want to create the cultural infrastructure by which people do what you want them to do when you're not there, when they don't even know you well.",

I would never send people to jail for doing drugs.\"I'm worried that we're slipping into a new consensus, where the professional class is so oriented toward the left that they're emphasizing the public goods component of those arguments &amp; deemphasizing the importance of entrepreneurship &amp; private innovation, but you need both.\"How to boost economic growth rate in US?\n\n- Commit to free trade\n- Support more scientific research\n- Deregulate housing\n- Deregulate all economic activity (except finance /environment)Why is religion is positive force for economic growth?\n\nWe're wired to think about the short-term. Religions, among other things, encourage people to have more kids and more generally be more long-term oriented. Like the Mormons.\n\nTyler's a pro-religious non-believer himself.US Healthcare doesn't even make you healthier\n\nIf you look at data, knee operations, back operations, etc They seem to have zero marginal product\n\nWe spend too much on the health care of older people and not enough on younger people\n\nIt takes too long to get a new drug approved.What would need to be true for you to believe that we're no longer in the great stagnation? \n\n\"So if driverless cars are truly up and running for fifty percent of the American population and you don't have to sit at the wheel that day. I will say the great stagnation is over.\"Advice on advice:\n\nWhen you give advice you've got to realize they're probably not going to listen. You're a placebo\n\nMeans you should think abt advice from a meta angle: i.e. should you encourage them to follow their instinct or not? If not, what need of theirs can you appeal to\"I think in a relationship you should neither be a maximizer nor a satisficer. If you're a maximizer the other person thinks you're taking advantage of them. If you're a satisficer, they'll think you're taking them for granted. Your focus should be to grow with that person.\"Litmus tests for friendship: \n\nDo I enjoy spending time w/ that person? is there mutual loyalty, common interests? are we evolving together?\n\nParadoxically, approaching friendship in a casual way can lead to real depth, whereas being too deliberate can lead to it seeming forced.Immigration:\n\nWe should have open borders w/ any country that has a more generous welfare state than we do, b/c then those people will not be coming for welfare, they'll be coming to work.\n\nWe've done a good job assimilating immigrants, better than anyone else, &amp; should do more.\"Erik let me redefine your (NBA-obsessed) childhood for you.\n\nYou spent your childhood obsessing over evaluating talent, &amp; strategy, &amp; NBA was the vessel you chose.\n\nAnd now as a VC you evaluate talent &amp; strategy. Maybe your early yrs were perfect prep\u2014can I talk you into that?\"\"If Tyrone came back, he'd write some pessimistic book. Like what if I wrote the best Marxist book?

    "full_text": "Here is a thread detailing some theories on social status, how it works, and what that means\ud83d\udc47\n\nTLDR: the goal of social behavior is to maximize social status.\n\nPursuing truth is often antithetical to that goal. Deceiving others (&amp; ourselves) often helps.\n\nhttps://t.co/gPwUk0KQhZSure, our main main goals are survival and reproduction. \n\nBut those things depend on being high status.\n\nWhy? \n\nHaving a good reputation is the best way to get people to work with you, take care of you, &amp; date you\n\nWhat is culture? The defaults behaviors that raise your statusHow does status work?\n\nImagine that we all have a number floating above our heads.\n\nThat's our status score. \n\nWe can't see it, but we all kind of know where we rank (dating apps sure do)\n\nOur brain works over time to perceive this in ourselves and others (in diff contexts too)Status is scarce\n\nSo people compete for it. Often violently.\n\nBut we also have to work together, so we've evolved to jockey for status without resorting to violence.\n\nHow? Signalling\n\nSignalling saves you from violence, but it means you're effectively BS-ing your way through lifeA good way of getting your way is using any means necessary to convince others, even deceiving.\n\nThis means you're often looking out for others deceiving you.\n\nThe best way to deceive is to not lie.\n\nBelieve your own bullshit so deeply that you don\u2019t produce any sign of cheating.What does this mean?\n\nTruth does not matter when you try to arrange a society. \n\nNot only it does not matter; it's harmful.\n\nYou basically can\u2019t have a functional &amp; long-standing society if the truth is widely known.\n\nWhy would truth be helpful anyway?\n\nhttps://t.co/nTEmneXBaDUnless truth raises our social status, we don't care. We don't even filter for it\u2014Not even on our radar\n\nThe true logic of emotions? Whatever helps us survive, reproduce (get status)\u2014at least 10,000 yr ago\n\nWhat does deception look like? Parroting high status opinions w/ no logicThankfully we've evolved the perfect equipment (e.g. consciousness) over many years to deceive others by deceiving ourselves\n\nLanguage is a tool to make up excuses to raise your status. That's more or less it\n\nIt's not a receptacle for or the origin of your thoughts, it's a tool.Truth is hard.\n\nNot only are you deceiving yourself all the time to raise your status, but other people are also deceiving you all the time  to raise theirs too.\n\nSo of course being able to manipulate your peers is more important than being able to correctly understand truth.People\u2019s statements are just signals in a long-standing status competition.\n\nKevin Simler and Robin Hanson wrote an entire book on this: https://t.co/NpLkkJw7mA\n\nConflict theory &amp; mistake theory get at two ways to address this: https://t.co/Lc9Z5CMWocTo be sure, Some people do get status from pursuing truth (scientists, writers, academics)\n\nThe more truth they pursue, the more status they get, b/c they're great at it.\n\nBut most people aren't good enough to gain any status from truth-discovery, so they refrain from pursuing itWhy would we be evolved for truth?\n\nIt takes time and effort, and it's not necessary\n\nTruth is often inconvenient for status\n\nIt's more effective to believe self-serving BS\n\nChange the rules of the game. When they go truth, you go BS\n\nWhatever you gotta do to survive &amp; reproduce.People will believe whatever gives them shortest path to social status.\n\nBut you may have noticed that people's actions don't match their beliefs.\n\nFor example, public schools for all, but best teachers for your kids.\n\n\"Egalitarianism when being selected, Elitism when selecting\".People get depressed hearing this, but the deception is not all bad; sometimes you want to hide things.\n\nThe whole concept of \"status\" altogether is a problematic truth, which is why we rarely acknowledge it explicitly and certainly resist making it legible to the internet.\n\nWhy?Genetical survival is often zero-sum, and even when it isn't, competition for mates is zero-sum.\n\nThis is a hard truth to coordinate around (that humans are inherently in conflict) \n\nSo we hide the idea of status &amp; pursue it secretly &amp; subconsciously, deceiving all along the way.So back to people's beliefs\n\nPeople will usually believe whatever improves their short-term status, whatever wins them approval from those they care about\n\n(Pick your role models carefully!)\n\nThe vast majority of ideas don\u2019t have short-term physical consequences; just social onesThis is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. \n\nDifferent ideas suit different people at different times\n\nIdeas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas.Which is why the culture war is so existential.\n\nBecause the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school cafeteria politics\n\nBecause people are just vessels, looking for a hit. They don\u2019t really care where they get it, only that it\u2019s good.Our understanding of the mind still assumes that people have \"ideas\" in their head and that \"reason\" determines how they behave.\n\nDoesn't take status into account.\n\nIt's like the Christian emphasis on \u201cfaith\u201d, i.e that some people have \u201cfaith\u201d, which makes them more noble people.Sometimes the logic gap is so strong that we know we are being deceptive.\n\nThis is what preference falsification is: People holding in their views b/c they're not socially safe.\n\nPpl are just trying to get by. Survive &amp; reproduce.\n\n**\nInterested in hearing feedback on these ideasIn conclusion:\n\n- Status drives behaviors (&amp; beliefs)\n\n- People only pursue (or even perceive) truth when it aligns with an increase in their status\n\n- As such, we've evolved to deceive others &amp; deceive ourselves so we can do that most effectively\n\nSo: Be https://t.co/IpH4Z3Deb3",
