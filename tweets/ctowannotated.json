    "full_text": "What is technology really? It’s principles and process. It’s a shift to an engineering mindset for relentless iteration and constant improvement; modular components that can be remixed and reused, and improvements that accrue and compound over time. Tech gives us tools beyond just software—continuous data streams to describe our health, circuits to program cells, scalpels to edit DNA, and the ability to create programmable, living medicines. Our focus is not just on the groundbreaking outputs of this shift, from novel gene and cell therapies to digital therapeutics and virtual care models, but on the underlying approach and drivers that created those breakthroughs. This is why it doesn’t work to simply tack on AI, or just insert tech into an established company. In order to re-program entire systems and re-imagine new approaches to massive challenges, whether those are biological, or man-made, you need to rethink the process from the ground up.\n",

If you use common ideas, someone else has already used them to grow and create value so you’re using the same idea and competing with a much bigger player, you’ll probably lose. Its new and novel / unorthodox ideas that win because you escape competition / compete in a different way and play to your advantages to win. Example elon musk tesla, they have to be scrappy and innovative and focus. They can’t make cars as well as established automakers, but they can out innovate them in specific markets\n\nWhen you compete to be the best, you imitate. When you compete to be unique, you innovate. In business, multiple winners can thrive and coexist. Innovation promotes healthy economic competition and growth\n",

Why do you have to press the camera button - why doesn’t the app open in the camera? Why are you saving your messages - isn’t that like saving all your phone calls?

Peoples expectations now are such that they expect this rapid increase in living standards and wages (growth). So they turn to liberal politicians to take the existing pie and redistribute it so this growth happens for the 90% paid for by the 10% and a lot of debt (aka distributing parts of the pie that don’t exist). This is harmful as it slows growth vs increasing the size of the pie and there will come a point where you can’t promise more of a pie that doesn’t exist (a debt crisis). The solution is to support silicon valley so they can innovate, create untold wealth (growing the pie), bring down costs etc. this will bring back the growth and grow the pie so everyone can have more.
