It’s principles and process. It’s a shift to an engineering mindset for relentless iteration and constant improvement; modular components that can be remixed and reused, and improvements that accrue and compound over time. Tech gives us tools beyond just software—continuous data streams to describe our health, circuits to program cells, scalpels to edit DNA, and the ability to create programmable, living medicines. Our focus is not just on the groundbreaking outputs of this shift, from novel gene and cell therapies to digital therapeutics and virtual care models, but on the underlying approach and drivers that created those breakthroughs. This is why it doesn’t work to simply tack on AI, or just insert tech into an established company. In order to re-program entire systems and re-imagine new approaches to massive challenges, whether those are biological, or man-made, you need to rethink the process from the ground up.

If you use common ideas, someone else has already used them to grow and create value so you’re using the same idea and competing with a much bigger player, you’ll probably lose. Its new and novel / unorthodox ideas that win because you escape competition / compete in a different way and play to your advantages to win.

- How to think about it
- What to hire for
- Who owns renewals?
- Common mistakes founders make
- How to pay for it 
- MetricsWhat's the best way to think about customer success—Is it a skill set? a function, a software stack?

Levels to customer success:

level 1: individual job function
level 2: a team that collaborates w/ all other post sales functions
level 3: company wide strategyRelationship between sales &amp; customer success: who owns renewal?

Depends!

If you're selling something that's $1K a yr or higher, it'smore of a team sport

After the sale, the customer is still talking to the salesperson abt expansion.Early days customer success person is helping drive product market fit by helping the engineers understand what are people using.

Over time CS managers get more metrics driven and start owning renewals.What are you looking for in your first customer success manager in the early team, maybe even before selling?

A strong utility player who can wear different hats from training the customer to supporting them to getting feedback to working w/ productWhat's profile of CS manager?

If your product is a little bit more transactional, they tend to me more product-oriented

If it's a high touch enterprise type deal, they tend to be a little more consultativeCommon mistake founders make about customer success:

In the beginning, CS managers need to be catch-all, but a mistake is keeping them as catch-all as you scale.

You should have a person doing training, another onboarding, etcHow to justify cost for CS as you scale?

You could say it's just cost of doing business, like support costs.

Another way is saying this is part of renewals expansion

Another is charging for it directly.Why does CS matter more today than it used to?

Before SaaS became dominant business model, you used to pay for everything upfront.

Now, it's pay as you go, and there's so many other competitors, that you have to keep earning your customer's business every step of the way.How else did this change building SaaS businesses? You now needed:

- More agile product strategy
- Different GTM strategy (old model was expensive sales channel partners. In new model, deals are smaller &amp; higher velocity)
- Marketing &amp; product can't be silo'edWhat metrics should CS managers prioritize?

Lagging indicators - Gross Retention Rate &amp; Net Renewal Rate (includes upsell) &amp; NPS

Leading indicators - Depends on product but could be overall adoption, daily active usage, NPS, e-mail engagement,Much of this was inspired by @nrmehta, CEO of @GainsightHQ and author of "Customer Success"

Read &amp; subscribe: https://t.co/6lPJ2E6yhjAggregation theory:

Pre-internet, you captured profits by controlling supply.  

Post-internet, you capture profits by aggregating demand.  

Internet made distribution free &amp; transaction costs zero. making it viable for a distributor to integrate forward with end users at scaleIn other words, the internet disintermediated the supplier -&gt; distributor -&gt; end user relationship by allowing digital content to be aggregated &amp; delivered directly to end user

0 Transaction costs means that adding 1 more customer is as simple as adding 1 more row in a databaseWhich means that the best companies win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycleTypes of aggregators:

Level 1: Supply Acquisition (e.g Netflix)

Level 2: Supply Transaction Costs (e.g. Uber)

Level 3: Zero Supply Costs 

Level 4: Super Aggregators (Zero marginal costs w/ users &amp; suppliers, advertisers (Fb, Google)Google is the best at doing the job of answering questions; which attracted content suppliers to formulate their content for Google, making it even better

FB started as the best place to find friends &amp; family, but over time evolved into being the best place to waste time periodAmazon is the best place to buy things; started w/ books, which attracted customers, which made possible offering more products, &amp; later merchants, which attracted more customers, eventually evolving into the hybrid store/merchant platform that https://t.co/00ITIABWMy is today.All super aggregators benefit from strong network effects, both on the supply and demand side; these network effects, supercharged by the ability to scale for free, are these companies’ moats.Newspapers used to enjoy local monopolies on distribution.

Google &amp; FB didn't create better newspapers, they reduced newspapers to any other type of content, and made it compete with all other content in the world.

https://t.co/kkp1bUYnHtPublishers took advertising for granted (or, as journalists put it, erected a “separation of church &amp; state”) under the assumption they had a monopoly on reader attention

Advertisers don’t care about readers; they care about identifying, reaching &amp; converting potential customersPublishers going forward need to have the exact opposite attitude from past publishers: instead of focusing on journalism first and biz model 2nd, publishers need to start w/ a sustainable biz model &amp; focus on journalism that works hand-in-hand with the biz model they've chosen.Publishers need to answer the most important Q required of any enterprise: are they a niche or scale business?

Niche businesses make money by maximizing revenue per user on a (relatively) small user base.

Scale businesses make money by maximizing the number of users they reach.The truth is most publications are trying to do a little bit of everything: gain more revenue per user here, reach more users over there. However, unless you’re the NYT, trying to do everything is a recipe for failing at everything

These strategies require diff approachesOn one side you will have the aggregators as ideal vehicles for content creators who value reach; on the other new kinds of tools that enable direct connection—&amp; funding—from fans. Maybe this whole Internet thing will turn out pretty good after all…unless you’re a publisher.Video is safer b/c it's very expensive to produce (or buy rights to), so hard to substitute 

Video has been increasingly differentiating itself on either quality (HBO) or exclusivity (ESPN)

The value of tech cos in each space is inversely proportional to value of the publishersThe rule of thumb around marketplace businesses is that you either have a low take rate and high margins or vice versa.

The challenge w/ Neither/New companies (e.g WeWork) end up with relatively low take rates combined w/ relatively mediocre margins.

They also might have a screw loose in at least 1-2 dimensions.

The ones that thrive are self-aware enough to know where their screws are loose, &amp; seek a compliment to solve for it.If you’re going to succeed as a startup, you need to be able to find and hire undiscovered talent. 

You cannot recruit people who are proven.

Why? There will always be large incumbents outbidding you when trying to hire known talented individuals

https://t.co/yuyx5Sogd3Quoting Vinod Khosla: “The team you build is the company you build”

Quoting Patrick Collison: “The reason why the first 10 employees are the most important is every one of those 10 employees is going to replicate him or herself 10 times.Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you’re hiring for:

Is it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)

Or are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you’re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)

Former is harder to hire for.When attempting to hire unrecognized potential, you'll inherently make mistakes (if you don’t, you’re too conservative)

Don’t try to be a “zero-defect hirer.”

The false-negative hires (the ppl you didn’t hire that could have been great) are more of a mistake than the bad hiresWhen you need upside, hire aptitude. When protecting against the downside, hire experience.

“When you’re trying to create something from scratch, experience is often a handicap”Double down on your stars:

If you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is way more important than trying to fix ppl who will never create 10x value. 

Management drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employees.What to do w/ struggling employees?

Most managers in baseball usually make the mistake of leaving in their starting pitcher too long, as opposed to calling for the relief pitcher

The starter got you so far, but you need a different skill set to go forward.How to identify stars? 

Notice who people in the company go to talk to that they don’t have to (watch whose desk becomes popular – this is especially noticeable in an open office).

That's how you discover the problem solvers“Constantly expand the scope of responsibility for every single employee. Everybody will break at some point, but you want to keep pushing the envelope until they can’t discharge that level of responsibly successfully anymore.”Benefits of small teams:

- People have an ownership mentality
- You can see who’s doing well
- It’s easier to spot the existing skill gaps
- People have a sense of independence
- A narrower focus/scope results, this improving executionUp until 20-50 employees, manage "through osmosis."

After that, weekly-wide company meeting, weekly 1on1s w/ 5-7 direct reports (direct report set agenda)

Everyone should understand the company’s priorities, business equation, biggest risks and plans to solve for them.In a startup, domain expertise isn’t all that important

Experts tend to know what you can’t do very well. They don’t ask enough why questions; ‘Why can’t this be done this way? I like people who don’t know what they’re tackling, but they’re fast learners.For investments: 

"I tend to like things that are super ambitious, that are almost ridiculous. Just how ridiculous? 

I want half of my VC friends to laugh at an investment I make. If half don’t laugh, it means I’m not taking enough risk, and the project isn’t ambitious enough."Criteria for founders: Magnet for Talent.

How to test?

Call former colleagues of the founder, and ask them if they would join (or invest in) the founder’s current company, and why/why notOn Total Available Market (TAM) Analyses:

The real issue with a small TAM is not that the market isn't big enough, it's that the value prop isn't compelling enough. If you make it more compelling, you'll capture more value.Startups have roughly the same amount of pain to go from 0 to 1, regardless of whether 1 is a $100 billion company or $100 million company, so you might as well do something important because the pain’s going to be the same. You might as well get the outcome that offsets the painHow to be strategic? Understand the business equation.

"Every business, when it works, is like an equation – X times Y times Z with some weighting. Understanding that equation in your brain, and being able to manipulate the variables, is the key to being strategic.”People w/ good strategy know what knobs they have at their disposal, which they can turn and how they affect each other. If you know one knob can only be turned up to 7, they don’t try to turn it to 8, they say “maybe we can turn this other knob up and it’s more likely to work”.Margins don’t matter as much as you think, but cash flow does:

Imagine you have a business that kicks off at 10% margins, but it grows to be 10% of everything on the planet – that’s a big business“If your tech is better, but potential customers are too set in their ways to switch, use it yourself and compete with them” 

"If you’re a company who’s better at reducing fraud, you don’t want to sell that as service to somebody else, you want to build the full stack yourselfBeing a component in someone else’s stack doesn’t usually end well

There’s the adoption risk issue (long sales cycles etc.)

There’s economic issues – you’re only capturing 10-30% of the value you create, if you’re selling to someone else, depending on how good you are at sales)As an example, if you have a differentiated advantage (say in chip design or battery life) you want to ship the end product to the customer yourself (and not sell your batteries to someone like Apple) – this way you get more credit for what you’re asymmetrically good at.Lesson learned from Pat Riley's Winner Within:

“You don’t want to be the best at what you do, you want to be the only one who does what you do”

You often have to narrow the scope of what you do to accomplish that.Keith’s Superpowers:

1/ Being able to spot 19-28-year-old people with talent, who have yet to be discovered or experience success, and project their future potential (and then go on to mentor or invest in them)

2/ Blending design thinking w/ empirical analysis.On deciding btwn founding v. join:

Find path w/ steepest slope. Something that makes you nervous/uncomfortable. If not, you’re not maximizing growth

Some learn best thrown into the deep end, try to swim (founding). Others learn best by watching first (joining)

Know your style.Once someone gets older, there’s enough data points on their resume where many people could evaluate their background and come to the same conclusion; their potential and abilities are well-defined.What you want to do is find someone that doesn’t have enough data points, and instead you have to try to project potential and how they may translate to a certain profession without knowing with certainty.For example, a CS student from Stanford is incredibly overrated in terms of demand for their talent versus what they can actually do on average. You have plenty of people throwing money at them. They don’t always develop the best work ethic because of that. They're entitled.What you want to find are people that other people aren’t chasing after but they have even more talent &amp; grit. That’s doable, but hard. It’s a little bit like drafting athletes in various sports. You're trying to find Tom Brady in the 6th round.What to look for in a co-founder? 

#1 Someone who can help you solve core risks to the biz. Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.

#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles (data vs design driven culture, closed vs open ecosystem, similar instincts on ppl).Is VC more like baseball or basketball:

Basketball: Team cohesion crucial, 1 Lebron can dominate, but can't have 3 bc not enough ball to go around

Baseball: Mostly collection of individuals &amp; clear accountability, can have many heavy hitters, 1 Lebron isn't as dominantDecision making framework:

Don’t make a list of pros and cons; that’s not a great way to make these kind of decisions.

Figure out your number one priority, and optimize on that dimension.Ben Franklin had this great quote which I’ve always used as a guide for my own decision-making and career. It’s, “Two ways to be successful in life: do something worth writing about or write something worth reading.”Favorite interview question:

What do you want to do with your life? That’s usually my first question. Sometimes it catches people off-guard, but it allows you to quickly understand who they are, what they care about, and calibrate your feedback.If you’re going to attract people with extremely high potential, the first thing you have to do is let them thrive. 

You have to give them the degrees of freedom to do both what they can do very well, and to some extent, allow them to make mistakes.If you try to constrain really talented people, you’re only going to create a mirror of yourself with your same strengths and weaknesses. 

You HAVE to let people do stuff that you disagree with. You can’t tell how good they are if they’re just replicating what you’d have them doManage People on Inputs, Not Outputs

Otherwise nobody on your team will take on the more difficult tasks.

So, to incentivize employees to complete ambitious tasks, gauge the quality of their work based on how it effective it was at getting you towards an ambitious goal.On why anti-lean startup:

The best metaphor for creating a startup is like producing a movie

Someone has a vision for a movie, writes a script, casts it, finances the production, markets the film with a trailer, and then distributes it (and hopefully people come to see it)Thiel used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. 

And we all rebelled, b/c it's so unnatural, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing.Calendar audit: when I work with CEOs, I ask them to specify their priorities they are, pie-chart style, and then pull out their calendar and see if it matches.

It never does. Recruiting is the big thing that doesn't align.“The whole fake news debate is ridiculous. The average American today is by any metric, more informed than the average American any time in history.”

Here's one narrative 👇SV tech folks could take the moral high ground against big bad corporations and people who were anti-open source. 

Startup culture became a self-confident ideological movement which created a ton of wealth and led to rise of things like YC, "The Social Network", and so on.Most of tech's opponents were on the broad implicit right — Republicans, mega corporations, military dictators that Twitter overthrew, etc.

Like Netflix to the studios, at first tech helped the left (e.g. helped Obama rise to power, led to Arab Spring, etc)But after Jobs’ death in 2011 and Obama’s election in 2012, though, other parts of the Democratic Party started to look at tech not just as a ready source of $ and talent, but as a possible threat.

For the left, they'd outlived their usefulness, overstayed their welcome.Tech had gone so far left it had ended up on the right.

China/Russia did this but in a different way. Went so far with communism they ended up on the nationalist right.In 2011, tech stopped becoming beloved to the left (&amp; started threatening their existence) for the following reasons.

- Economically attacking traditional American left power centers (NYT, Hollywood, Academia)

- Undercutting prestige &amp; influence (e.g. fake news)- Pulling away top talent to tech companies

- Becoming a more powerful global culture exporter

- Building a network of super-wealthy people w/ an alternative network and path to power (Instead of become president, become CEO).

- The outcome of 2016 election.One thing they implicitly mean by “threat to democracy” is that tech is disruptive to how they work:

Harvard does a study, NYT reports it, US gov’t enacts it

What do they want? Power. Protect their existing institutions (NYT, Harvard, Big Gov't)

“The thing that I like to assume is every startup idea’s been tried… So, the question is not, Has my idea been tried before? The question is, Is it the right time for my idea to happen?"A startup isn’t a company until it hacks its way through 3 distinct miracles:   

1) The insight hack (insight development)

2) The value hack (customer development)

3) Growth hacking (going from 0-1 to 1-X)Value hacking:

Figure out what you can uniquely do that ppl are desperate for

Identify a focus group of customers that desperately need your solution

Iterate &amp; improve your value proposition relentlessly until you start to see signs of exponential organic growthIf your value prop as a startup isn’t true enough, &amp; your customer isn’t desperate enough, you won’t grow exponentially. You’ll instead have to spend $ to overcome the objections to the gaps in your value prop.

Only think about growth after you’ve proven your value hypothesis.On ideas:

Most people are looking around their present world and searching for "white space" -- "startup opportunity". 

Instead, live in the future, find what's missing, and then show people the way forward.It might be time to start your startup when:

You have insider knowledge about a major change event.

You know the market opportunity and customer needs in a visceral way.

You have a vision of a problem to be solved based on your knowledge of the first two pointsHow do you know when it’s time to double down on an idea?

When no one can talk you out of doing it

If there’s anyone reasonable who can talk you out of it, you’re probably not ready for it

Or when the pain of regret from not trying &gt; any possible pain experienced from failing"Sometimes the world puts an opportunity in front of you that you’re in a unique position to capitalize on before others, that leverages a unique domain skill you have, and takes advantage of something you’ve seen before others because of your vantage point. It’s tempting to say:"You’ll tackle it when you’re ready—when you have your things in place, when you have your ducks in a row, when the economy is more stable … But the reality is, if you plan to start something great, these kinds of opportunities are extremely rare—maybe even once in a lifetime."The startup law of the jungle:

Startups are initially very vulnerable to predators (like a newborn animal on the plains) 

Being non-consensus and right affords the startup the time to survive, adapt, and &amp; – no one preys on them because no one believes their idea’s importantWith your product, have a good answer to the question: “What job do our customers hire this product to do?”

When you buy a new product, you hire it to help you do a job

If the product does the job well, you’ll tend to hire it again

If it does a bad job, you’ll fire itWhen you’re starting a startup, you’re going to war together. You gotta know you want to be in the fox hole with this person. You GOTTA know it. Because it’s impossible enough as it is. A lot of these startups fail because the founders can’t see eye to eye on what has to happenLaunching Paradox:
