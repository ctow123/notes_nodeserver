Zooming out:\n\nLPs used to do 60% public stocks, 40% liquid bonds.\n\nThe next evolution was going heavy into illiquid alternative assets (PE, VC, and natural resources)\n\nYou could arbitrage your long time horizon as an institution to garner outsized gains by embracing illiquidity So they allocated meaningful chunks of portfolio to PE broadly.\n\nMaybe 3/4 buyout funds, 1/4 VC. All illiquid.\n\nOver last decade, all of these have performed well for the most part, which has grown their PE allocations perhaps double where they want to be. Also, there's been a huge expansion in people starting VC/PE funds, raising more money &amp; on quicker time scales.\n\nMore funds getting bigger raising faster.\n\nThe top players in the asset class has been performing, so they've gotten away with it, even though LPs were over-allocated So, imagine in a recession where stock market drops significantly.\n\nLiquid part of the portfolio shrinks.\n\nIlliquid part of the portfolio rises accordingly.\n\nThe illiquid part was too big to begin with!\n\nAnd since liquid part down, that means PE valuations drop too. So the illiquid part isn't going to have the returns they\u00a0thought.\n\nBut the marks on illiquid assets arrive a lot later than public stock\u00a0prices.\n\nSo now they're significantly more allocated to the alternative assets portion of their portfolio (PE/VC)\n\nWhat do they do? Rebalance their portfolios.\n\nSo it looks like less PE/VC as a result.\n\nAnd these are the endowments, the professional LPs.\n\nWhat about the new LPs, who bought in at the top into new funds with no track records?\n\nYep. It's harder for new funds trying to get off the ground now.

Laborers largely live pay-check to pay-check. So their income grows at the level of GDP per capita.\n\nRentiers live of interest of their principal, so their income largely grows on rate of return on capital (one check on this is pop growth)\n\nhttps://t.co/csGldkILhr When the rate of return on capital exceeds the growth rate of the economy (as it did through much of history until the 19th century and as is likely to be the case again in the 21st century), then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income. In normal times, the rate of return on capital averages about 4% \u2013 5% per year, and the GDP per capita growth rate averages about 1% to 1.5% per year. \n\nSo in normal times, rentiers\u2019 yearly incomes should be growing more than laborers\u2019, which would increase inequality During wars &amp; crises however, rentiers are worse off than laborers relatively. \n\nHyper inflation, asset destruction, gov't interference, wealth taxes, are all likely to hit rentiers the hardest. 1914-1945 was an example of this. Piketty references Jane Austen novels which show how much time money matters take up. \n\nEven with someone who has 5x average income, it was necessary to spend most of one\u2019s time attending to the needs of daily life.\n\nGrateful for economic growth that has changed that for many. Contrary to the popular consensus today, the American Dream was very real for most of America\u2019s history. \n\nThis was due to the fact that America (as a new country) had less time to accumulate a rentier class, which takes a couple generations for the fortunes to really multiply. Rentier class used to be top 1%. Now it's top 0.1%. Why?\n\n- Have a bunch of super laborers who make money both on labor &amp; on their principal (e.g CEOs). Fewer rich bums these days. :)\n\n- Capital is disproportionately tied up in institutions (endowments, sovereign wealth funds) There's growing income in equality among labor. The share of top 10% (top 1% in particular) has been growing for decades.\n\nCEO salary has been rising steadily. Why?\n\n- Maybe it's just the market\n- Maybe it's low taxes relative to 1980s\n- Maybe it's corporate governance The Rich get richer faster than others.\n\nPeople like Bill Gates grow their fortune at 8-10% a year, double Piketty's 4-5% return on capital.\n\nThe richest endowments grow at 10% yearly as well. Medium rich endowments grow at 7-8%. Avg person saving for retirement is 4-5%. All of this suggests increasing global inequality. \n\nWhich is why Piketty suggests a global tax on wealth.\n\nMaybe fixing housing would help here, as that transfers wealth from laborers to rentiers.\n\nOr fixing colleges, which also puts laborers in debt.\n\nOr increasing birth rates. Personally, I am more excited about fixing wealth inequality by enabling people to have equity in companies (perhaps by a token-like mechanism), such that people are directly and legibly aligned with economic growth.\n\nShare the pie as you expand it.\n\nhttps://t.co/XqywrvtVla This was a great book review that inspired these notes as well: https://t.co/guKzjQcn1l "}, {"thread": "Saul Linksy's \"Rules for Radicals\" pioneered a certain political meta game. \n\nBret Weinstein articulates the tactics used by social justice movement to achieve institutional power in this vid\n\nInterested in hearing counterpoints\n\nSummary of his thoughts\ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://t.co/hlBVVXkE0n Paraphrasing: Social justice is less a fleshed out logical argument than it is a rhetorical perspective shift\n\nSJ has achieved immunity to inquiry\n\n&amp; Yet it has built a home in the institution that you'd think is the safe haven for inquiry: universities \n\nhttps://t.co/PFvHp3Hgbv Tactic 1: Redefining concepts of prejudice such that the criteria is much more expansive but we keep the same punishment as the old crime\n\nWhile also not explicitly defining them so ppl are violating by default, &amp; dunno how to comply even if they want to\n\nhttps://t.co/SrKdjNREJO One example is the word equality, now rebranded as equity\n\nIt used to ~mean same legal treatment.

In an honor culture, it is important to refuse to be dominated by anyone.\n\nPeople are highly sensitive to slights and respond to any indication of disrespect with immediate aggression (e.g. dueling)\n\nThey feel appealing to external authority is \"beneath them\" (e.g. snitches) In a victimhood culture, moral status based on suffering. And if victimhood is a virtue, privilege is a vice. It has the same relationship to victimhood that cowardice does to honor. Checking one's privilege is analogous to the shaming of cowards that we see in honor cultures. Disclaimers: \n\n\"To say that being recognized as a victim raises one\u2019s moral status does not imply that any particular victim is cynically taking advantage of this fact. It does not imply that any particular victim sought out or enjoys whatever status victimhood conveys. \"It does not imply that this status outweighs other disadvantages they might have.

What leads to victimhood culture?\n\nThe presence and power of social superiors in many aspects of our lives makes reliance on third parties increasingly attractive.\n\nCombined with a shortage of strong ties and a surfeit of weak ones, it makes public complaint increasingly likely. Also generational differences in childhood with those growing up in recent decades experiencing drastically higher degrees of adult supervision, regulation, and protection\n\nThis happens partly because of greater involvement in school and other adult-supervised activities.

A sign of stagnation is that it there's a relative lack of new ideas to challenge the prevailing world order.\n\nStagnation also means everyone is competing for status since the pie isn't expanding.\n\nThere's some stability, but it's short-term. \n\nEventually individualism re-emerges So the phase of population growth coincides with individualism &amp; rationalism, and the phase of decreased population coincides with collectivism &amp; mysticism\n\nThe latter is not a dark age, b/c there's stability &amp; gov't power, but it's not a Golden age either, b/c it's authoritarian https://t.co/9UsuWFOIqx They have effective government like Golden Ages, but aren't creative like them. \n\nThey're stagnant like Dark Ages, but aren't chaotic like them. \n\nThey're a combination of Golden &amp; Dark Age\u2014A Brown Age.\n\nThere are 4 types of ages: Green, Yellow, Brown, Black.

It has to rely on economies of scale or adjacent markets to scale Marketplace Eras:\n\nListing Era provided lead gen. (e.g. Craigslist, Grubhub, Yelp)\n\nTransactional marketplaces facilitated transactions on platform. (e.g. Thumbtack, Fiverr)\n\nManaged Marketplaces integrated w/ supply or owned supply outright (e.g. Honor, Clutter) https://t.co/zKAxOTer3N Managed Marketplaces:\n\nBear take: Capital intensive, lower margins, less scalable, handicap network effects b/c you commoditize supply \n\nBull take: It's a more controlled &amp; thus higher quality experience, can do lower margins if TAM is in trillions (e.g. healthcare Vertical marketplaces:\n\nEnable a 10x better experience.\n\nFor example, you could buy tickets on Craigslist &amp; eBay.\n\nBut Stubhub integrated w/ ticket providers so you could also verify identity and get seating charts.\n\nSlice does this for pizza ordering. Vertical marketplaces\n\n\"1- Look at large horizontal marketplaces, identify the verticals w/ low NPS, &amp; use product to leapfrog the liquidity of the incumbent\u2019s supply base\n\n2- Nail a small, overlooked and under-appreciated niche, then land &amp; expand from there\"\n\n- @sarahtavel Vertical vs Horizontal Marketplaces:\n\nIf you play this out 10 years, can you imagine people have 20 apps for different service categories on their phone? Probably not.\n\nSo vertical marketplaces either likely have to expand and become horizontal, or get acquired. Double commit marketplaces: Marketplaces that pick supply for you (e.g. Uber).\n\nIf you do enough work, it looks like the marketplace is the provider rather than the individual suppliers (e.g. Amazon).\n\nFor this to work you need to highly curate supply and  match effectively. B2B Marketplaces:\n\nWhy Now? \n\n- After 10+ yrs of consumer marketplaces, we're finally getting to b2b.\n\n- Today's business owners are more tech-savvy.\n\n- B2B requires domain experience to see the opportunity, unlike consumer\n\n- Selling to SMEs where they are fragmented. Factors of a Healthy Marketplace:\n\n- Fragmented supply\n- Not prone to monogamy (e.g babysitters)\n- User experience has to be 10x better than status quo\n- Low friction for supplier to sign up\n- High frequency &amp; high AOV\n- In the payments flow\n- Good reason to stay on platform Labor Marketplaces:\n\n- If you're successful, you lose a customer (they get a job). Thus more of a marketing play\n\n- Vertical marketplaces unbundling LinkedIn can work if they offer value beyond job (e.g RigUp creates a network of profiles for the industry, including reviews etc) Human capital marketplaces:\n\nBiggest underutilized asset of all time is people's time: https://t.co/LkmbaVK5wi\n\nP2P Marketplaces: https://t.co/iowARJuJ1S\n\nLots of data that can be leveraged for people matching (e.g what I'm reading, purchasing, etc) Building marketplaces:\n\n- Identify \"red hot center\" - the group that feels the pain most acutely b/c they'll jump through hoops to use the product initially.\n\n- Main way to create magic for demand is to have the right supply. If you have exclusive lock over supply, that's a moat. How to solve Chicken &amp; Egg problem:\n\nConstrain marketplace to a geo or category you can own\n\nNail one side of the marketplace (usually supply)\n\nBiggest way to grow supply is sales ppl.\n\nBiggest way to grow demand is word of mouth--or when supply brings demand (e.g. Eventbrite) Liquidity is what matters:\n\nCraigslist even w/ horrible experience did $1B last yr b/c of liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is basically how well that you can satisfy user demand. How well supply and demand value props match. Conversion rate is one proxy for that. Redefine the atomic unit of supply and therefore dramatically expand the addressable supply.\n\nHomeAway stayed limited to vacation home rentals until Airbnb redefined and expanded the atomic unit of supply which enabled them to own it instead of share it. \n\nhttps://t.co/ZRes9bhCkd Correct post link here: https://t.co/1fTp9xa5Um Leverage an underutilized fixed asset \n\nEnables supplier acquisition to scale a lot easier\n\nHipcamp leverages underutilized land\n\nCloudkitchens leverage underutilized kitchens\n\nAirBnB leverages underutilized properties\n\nUber leverages underutilized cars\n\nhttps://t.co/vGK8Aoeube Unit economics:\n\n- Recoup fully loaded cost CAC on a net contribution margin basis in the first 6 months of the business\n\n- 3x your CAC in 18 months\n\n- Don't know LTV in beginning b/c you have negative churn Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Overvalue GMV growth, undervalue net revenue &amp; unit economics. Not charging\n\n- Overvalue growth at expense of liquidity &amp; creating more value for incremental next user\n\n- Relying on paid acq.\n\n- Scale too quickly instead of \"nail it before you scale it\" On whether to expand verticals:\n\nThe Q to ask is \"Does this lead to stronger PM-fit, or am I expanding just b/c I'm supposed to?\"\n\nAirBnB smartly didn't expand immediately to AirBnB for dogs, boats, etc.\n\nRover waited too long to expand.\n\nMost cos expand too fast though.

Per Coarse, it's easier to organize in a corporation than as freelancers (e.g. \"transaction costs\"\n\nSimilarly, political parties are more effective for enacting political action. And the same way corporations look for certain types of employees (e.g. being too \"entrepreneurial\" may mean they might leave soon), political parties are incentivized to look for certain kinds of people (e.g. loyal, dependent people)\n\nhttps://t.co/R14zsN3qtn Similar to how when corporations dominate in one area &amp; try to expand into other areas, political firms do the same.\n\nBesides the three branches of gov't, there's the press, the education system, etc.\n\nPer the invisible hand, If there is power to be grabbed, someone will grab it.

Those ideas change. I'm referring to the broader trend of egalitarianism eats the world.\n\nThe Left is egalitarianism, and the world has increasingly gotten more egalitarian overtime. \n\nhttps://t.co/xluhnAtug6 By \"Left\" and \"Right\" I mean the specific tactics, not policies.

But it turns them evil.\n\n(e.g. Fascists used communist tactics against the communists.) So why does Left keep winning?\n\nDominion: The Left is just an extension of Christianity without Christ\n\nUniversalism is the idea that there are universal human rights and that all people are created equal\n\nThe translation of catholicism is \"universalism\"\n\nhttps://t.co/e373Efk4Hw Why else do they win?\n\n- We evolved in egalitarian forager groups, so egalitarianism naturally resonates w people\n\n- Promising people higher status is a brilliant strategy: https://t.co/tfYf9JwYtn\n\n- The Left is better at organizing (compared to, say libertarians) &amp; wants it more Scarface: \u201cFirst you get the money, then you get the power...\u201d\n\nThe left goes straight to power, using the state as the mechanism to achieve its goals.\n\nWhich is why they keep trying to load up the state with power even when the state is run by someone they hate, like right now. It\u2019s also why they dislike capitalism\n\nCapitalism and wealth creation is power outside the state\n\nAnything that promotes agency, individual responsibility, free speech\u2014these are all against the state expanding power, so they don't like it\n\nThe more dependent folks are, the better Of course, there are benefits of egalitarianism up to a point.\n\nWhere's that line?\nWhere's the in-between?\nWho are the moderates?\n\nToo much egalitarianism and you destroy excellence. Vice versa.\n\nThe middle has been totally hallowed out. No stopping point: https://t.co/XE01fi5CL5 The main reason the middle is weak is because \"activists for the middle\" is basically an oxymoron: people with tons of political energy are naturally drawn to extremes\n\nAdd to that our clickbait corporate media landscape and social media thought police dynamic, &amp; that explains it B/c of Ricky Gervais or Dave Chapelle, people think wokeness is fading out, but it's mainstreaming into our institutions (e.g. universities, media, HR departments) and our laws, and it'll take decades to reverse once we decide we decide we want to. \n\nhttps://t.co/ofuqMFsrr9 To be sure, the right is unhinged as well, although in a different way: The right focuses on the past, the left is on the future.\n\nRight is substance, left is optics.

Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles of company building There is a narrative that founders have to either be college friends or worked together before\n\nI think this is less true than we think\n\nFounders of Coinbase initially met on Reddit I believe?\n\nFounders of Stemcentrx met on Craigslist!\n\nYou might be too afraid to fire your friend Back when, ppl were embarrassed to say they met their spouse via apps, &amp; instead prefer \"at a bar\".\n\nToday, a curated app sounds more thoughtful than the randomness of a bar.\n\nSo with co-founders too: We'll laugh at how we preferred the randomness of school to an app or program. Just like many marriages end up in divorce, and so it\u2019s worth rethinking the dating/matching process\u2014\n\nOne of biggest killer of startups is founder breakups, and so it\u2019s worth re-considering co-founder matching. If you don\u2019t already have a cofounder in your network, how do you \u201cdate\u201d?\n\nBuild top of funnel by:\n\n- Telling the world what you\u2019re thinking (e.g. writing a post, hosting a meetup, etc)\n- Join On Deck (https://t.co/dw9qXrOjiF)\n- Build an audience: What to look for in a co-founder?\n\n- Complimentary skills (how do you, together, have an unfair advantage?)\n- Value-mission alignment (what success looks like, etc)\n- Company alignment (who makes decisions, what tradeoffs you will/won\u2019t accept) You\u2019ve found the person, but you don\u2019t want to shot-gun--then what?\n\n- Go on a road trip or other intense experience (e.g. live together)\n- Do a hackathon (or work together in trying conditions)\n- Meet the spouse and/or parents if you can (seriously!) Non-obvious Q\u2019s to ask:\n\nIn what ways are you crazy? What are your failure modes?\n\nWhat was it like working with ex co-founders?\n\nIf this didn't work out, why not?\n\nWhat's most important to you ($? Managing People? Fame?)\n\nWho should be CEO? Who has the vision? When picking co-founders, it's important to know:\n\n\"Are you the co-founder who has clarity around the vision or are you the co-founder that's gonna build it?\"\n\nFailure mode: Both think they're in charge of vision, &amp; then they constantly butt heads over what direction to go in. Another common co-founder failure mode: Different goals.\n\nOne co-founder wants to make $50m from their startup in 5 yrs, and another wants to never sell.\n\nSometimes you can reconcile different goals, you just have to ensure they're not incompatible w/ each other long-term Talk early and often about:\n\n- What success looks like (outcomes, culture, roles)\n- Non-negotiables\n- Who\u2019s in charge in case of disagreement\n\nOn this last point: Make sure there is a clear CEO / tie-breaker\n\nWork together under stress early so you can simulate hard times. Early on also figure out:\n\n- Personal runway &amp; how much salary they'd need\n- Other extenuating life circumstances \n- 5-20 yr vision for their lives\n- How each wants to scale w/ the company\n- Equity split (prob 50/50) You don\u2019t need to be best friends. (Or even friends at all.)\n\nYou need to respect &amp; trust each other, communicate effectively, and work well together in accomplishing company goals. \n\nAnd not hate going to work every day. Cofounder relationships are like marriages, and should be treated as such\u2014something work on consistently.\n\n- Read relationships/communication books (e.g NVC)\n- Both see a coach\n- Date first. \"Try before you buy\"\n\nBut just like marriage, if it's too much work might not be a fit. What kills startups is never finding Product Market Fit &amp; co-founder issues.\n\nMinimize co-founder issues so you can maximize time spent on finding PMF.\n\nPlus, most co-founder issues stem from not enough PMF to begin with.\n\nSome stem from too much, but those are the good kind. :) Treat co-founder search like any other recruiting process:\n\nhttps://t.co/dCz3y47WX3 "}, {"thread": "amazing rappers right now. https://t.co/cXC5Iw7uWx https://t.co/feCnFX69jR https://t.co/ZRMCFuAX8K We just had Asher Roth's dad come on.\n\nAlmost 50 ppl in here "}, {"thread": "Why did tech become so popular (and then unpopular) with elites over the last decade?\n\nHere's one narrative \ud83d\udc47 SV tech folks could take the moral high ground against big bad corporations and people who were anti-open source. \n\nStartup culture became a self-confident ideological movement which created a ton of wealth and led to rise of things like YC, \"The Social Network\", and so on.

Tech had gone so far left it had ended up on the right.\n\nChina/Russia did this but in a different way. Went so far with communism they ended up on the nationalist right. In 2011, tech stopped becoming beloved to the left (&amp; started threatening their existence) for the following reasons.\n\n- Economically attacking traditional American left power centers (NYT, Hollywood, Academia)\n\n- Undercutting prestige &amp; influence (e.g. fake news) - Pulling away top talent to tech companies\n\n- Becoming a more powerful global culture exporter\n\n- Building a network of super-wealthy people w/ an alternative network and path to power (Instead of become president, become CEO).\n\n- The outcome of 2016 election.

We don't just imitate on a monkey see/do level. We imitate on a perception level. We imitate what we perceive our neighbor's desires to be. We don't first think &amp; then desire\u2014the opposite.\n\nhttps://t.co/ruyPD58Jdy The more similar we are, the more we'll want the same things\n\nAnd the more we want the same things, the more we'll tend to fight over the scarce good (or status)\n\nAnd so we face a permanent threat of runaway violence\n\nConflict brings convergence, which then brings more conflict. We want others to love what we love, admire what we admire, but when they do, we suddenly find that they have become competitors, leading to conflict\n\nMentor/mentee dynamic is a perfect example. Master wants pupil to imitate the master up until the pupil becomes the master. The first cultures dealt with threat of runaway violence  by transferring their violence to a surrogate victim, a scapegoat whose death/expulsion unites and ends violence\n\nThe antidote to chaos is the ritual scapegoating of a common enemy\n\n\"the foundational murder\" / \"noble lie\" And because the community owes its entire order to its victim, the victim is worshipped as scared\n\nBut at the same time, the victim is also believed to be  guilty, and therefore deserving of the collective violence\n\nScapegoating worked in restoring order, so people kept doing it People need something to blame to hide from the fact that they are angry out of endlessly imitating each other. \n\nNeed a safe space to place all their violence.\n\nScapegoating is the protection of the community against violence that it could not otherwise control The scapegoat ritual addresses the threat of uncontrolled violence, which is endemic to human society b/c of runaway mimetic desire leading to conflict. \n\nRituals of sacrifice averted this crisis by reconciling everyone around a sacrificial victim. \n\nIt's a collective release. However, scapegoating preserves social peace only so long as the scapegoaters think it's justified\n\nThat, after all, was the definition of scapegoating: persecution of an innocent victim believed to be guilty\n\nChristianity, of course, inverts this myth. Now the victim's innocent If you see the truth of that violence, suddenly that violence repels you\n\nJesus's cross instead of ratifying his guilt, proclaims his innocence\n\nBefore the cross, every violence is portrayed as heroic in literature\n\nNow, not anymore. Scapegoating's no longer sacred. Left a vacuum Jesus says, If you have to imitate someone, imitate me, because I won't imitate others and I won't become your rival. And imitate others who imitate me too.\n\nInstead of eye for an eye, turn the other cheek. \n\nInstead of sanctifying sacrificial violence, sanctify love and mercy. Jesus introduced a new spirit of self-awareness &amp; self-criticism\n\nMore so than anytime in history, we're aware of our faults. The west is the only place where we self-flagellate our own culture to gain status\n\nIronically, this is Christianity w/o Christ\n\nhttps://t.co/hL9dD37hk2 Today, we see the violence of Christianity, we don't see the violence, Christianity has prevented all through history\n\nChristianity didn't invent violence, but it did contribute to curbing it\n\nWhere did we get your sensitivity to violence, after all? Certainly wasn't Oedipus Rex Eye for an eye today seems primitive, but at the time it was revolutionary. It advocated for reciprocal violence instead of escalation, which used to be the norm. \n\nB/c we don\u2019t want to renounce scapegoating, we keep attempting sacrificial violence, but it doesn\u2019t bind us anymore Remember, the importance of sacred sacrificial violence in the primordial past was that it bound us together. It prevented us from contagiously envying one another to the point where we\u2019re obsessed with destroying each other rather than just getting on with life. Ironically, as society became both more egalitarian and meritocratic, and hierarchies were less rigid, mimetic competition skyrocketed.\n\nWhere previously people were only competing with their own caste, now they were competing with everyone in the world, &amp; expected to win. Chaos. Nietzsche knew that Christianity was the reason why that resentment was building to such a deep level that once we killed the idea of a God that kept hierarchies stable, mimetic mayhem would ensue\n\nResentiment is a begrudging those who you perceive to have things that you desire We didn't stop burning witches bc of the scientific method, we got the scientific method bc we stopped burning witches\n\nIf, say, ppl's crops were dying, &amp; they burned a \"witch\", &amp; then crops grew, they kept doing it\n\nWhen they stopped, they could evaluate other reasons (science!) People will always find scapegoats.\n\n\"Experience suggests that if men cannot struggle on behalf of a just cause b/c that just cause was victorious in an earlier generation....They will struggle, out of a certain boredom: for they cannot imagine living in a world without struggle\" Today it's this game of guilt, hot potato, where we're becoming more increasingly haunted by our guilt in collective violence. And we're trying to throw that hot potato onto somebody else\n\nScapegoating used to literally mean the transferring of sins to the goats. Now we do people We\u2019re half Christian. \n\nWe\u2019re thoroughly within the fishbowl of Christianity, but we\u2019re, only half Christian in the sense that we\u2019re aware of victimization, but we don\u2019t want to fully recognize how it affects what we do today, and so we justify violence in victimization's name Today, we have new problems. \n\nJesus popped the scape goat bubble told us to imitate him, but we don't want to anymore. \n\nMob frenzies and scapegoating are society trying to purge itself of its own\u00a0demons. Secular Christianity imports from real Christianity what Nietzsche called \u201cslave mentality\u201d, the glorification of the victim. \u201cThe first shall be last and the last shall be first.\u201d And so if your sense of self identity and morality is all wrapped up in that, then any differential success you or other people may achieve is evidence of evil\n\nAnd so the source of that evil must be identified and eliminated. The cycle will repeat until either every possible scapegoat is dead or the movement burns itself out.\n\nWe all have the motivation to purge our sense of collective sin, independent of the guilt or innocence of the subject.\n\nAnd the overpowering need to participate. In a post-modern world, what's the answer?\n\nLiberalism. Tolerance. Due process. Reason. Free speech.\n\nhttps://t.co/wog92EwQ5b\n\nThese are more scattered thoughts than a deep dive, would welcome any follow up analyses or your own takeaways from Girard.

What's unclear?\" When pitching:\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to consider the biggest reasons an investor might *not* invest, and pre-emptively address those reasons.\n\nIf you\u2019ve solved for them, point to evidence.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, point to how you\u2019ll address them, and the moat you\u2019ve built to date. Ask in the beginning:\n\n\"Do you believe there will be a multi-billion dollar co in the space?\"\n\nIf no \u2014&gt; don\u2019t go further until yes\n\nIf yes \u2014&gt; here's our unfair advantage and why now (instead of 5 yrs ago or 5 yrs from now) When fundraising for a complex co, you might simplify it for investors by saying something like:\n\n\"In order to invest, you'd have to believe that we can execute on X, so that we have Y, which will lead to a multi-billion $ biz.\"\n\nFrame it simply so they can pitch their partners. A founder told me it was reasonable to him that the conversation break down in an founder-to-investor pitch would be 90% founder, 10% investor.\n\nIMO it should be closer to 50/50. The more they talk and ask Qs, the closer they are to getting to a yes. Unconfident fundraisers talk 90% of the time, hammer home hand-wavy talking points, &amp; grasp at straws for what they think VCs wanna hear.\n\nConfident fundraisers listen 50% of the time, ask questions, &amp; admit the risks to investing as well as what they have &amp; haven't proven yet. After pitching, one thing you may try \u2014 under the context of your improvement \u2014 is asking them to role play as if they were pitching your biz to their partnership.\n\nIf they don\u2019t pitch it well, that may tell you something. Conversely, you may like their phrasing better. VCs will say nice things but It's always a no until it's a yes\n\nMost likely nearly all investors will say no but you only need one or a few to say yes.\n\nYou're going to feel like a total failure at it until someone says yes and then you feel like a huge success.

If they're in the role for 12 months, how do you know that they've been successful? Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for.

Building a interview process:\n\nTreat it like a scientific experiment\u2014You have a control group and you keep the criteria the same.\n\nMake sure that these candidates are asked the same questions in the same order. And you're evaluating them on the same thing so you can compare them. Have a \"scorecard\" that has the attributes you're looking for in the candidate per position, how much they matter, &amp; split up interviews accordingly.\n\nWhatever your hiring process is, codify it, and make sure everyone has access to it.\n\nBefore interviews, have Q's ahead of time. Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Decide too quickly whether they should hire this person or not. That's why it's important to have a checklist\n\n- Pick five qualities that you want to hire for and design questions for every quality. Have interviewers rate 1-5 &amp; compare. Calibrate raters Sample interview Q's:\n\n- If you were me, what kind of candidate would you be looking for?\n- If you joined &amp; then left in 3 months, why would that be?\n- What was your last boss like?

Struggles? Who did you work closely w/ &amp; how would they rate the candidate from 1-10, in your opinion?\"\n\nThen reference. Reference philosophy:\n\n- On &amp; off-book references.\n\n- Decrease defensiveness to get better answers. Start by saying \"We really like X and we'd be excited to work w/ them. Curious to ask Q's to best set them up for success.\"\n\n- Do video to see body language. Q's to ask references:\n\n- How do they react to frustration?\n\n- What would that person's critic say? or last performance review?\n\n- Describe the ideal role?\n\n- Is this top 5% ppl you've worked w/? or Rate 1-10 but no 7.\n\n- If this didn't work out, why not?\n\nhttps://t.co/VvDjCR2hp9 When referencing:\n\n- Sell the reference giver on why it's such an amazing opportunity!\n\n- Ask them for referrals for other great ppl that should join\n\n- Consider recruiting them if they are a fit &amp; seem interested!\n\n- Close the loop when you make them an offer. Make them an ally. Mistakes founders make: not optimizing candidate experience.\n\nWhen you interview the candidate, the candidate is selling you. But you should also be selling them\n\nNot only does that help you close the ppl you want to hire, but actually creates like word of mouth effect for others How to give a great candidate experience\n\n- Clear expectations of role across team\n- Consistent communication\n- Transparent &amp; sensible process\n- Social time w/ the team\n- Respect their time, particularly w/ take home work\n- Make them feel special, not a cog\n- Quality interviews Closing candidates:\n\nIf you're unable to close candidates, then all else is meaningless.\n\nIt's also demoralizing to existing employees who interview the candidates (\"If they don't want to work here, why am I?\"\n\nSell the mission, the team, &amp; the opportunity. Make it compelling. Closing:\n\n- Aim for ~70% close rate.\n\n- Only make an offer when you're sure they'll accept. (\"If we give you X,Y, Z, would you accept?\")\n\n- Identify who influences their decision and take them out to dinner w/ candidate (spouse? peer?)\n\n- Enlist reference as an ally in closing. Closing:\n\nHave the investor sell the candidate on why they invested, why it'll be an enormous outcome, &amp; how they think about the team from an \"unbiased\" POV, and how the investor likes to invest in their employees future career success (perhaps even back their eventual startup)! Closing:\n\n- Q4 is best time to recruit. Holidays are reflective, post Q4 bonus, ppl are most ready to jump\n\n- Weather also helps. NYC kid comes in winter to SF &amp; sees sunshine...\n\n- 4 yr vest is natural, but don't be shy 1 mo after ppl join new co, in case it wasn't the right fit Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Not allocating enough time to recruiting, esp. passive candidates.\n\n- CEOs think they have to build, but after they raise money their job is to hire people who can build.\n\n- Over 50% of founder's time should be spent hiring. They rarely spend enough. A hire isn't truly a hire until they've completed 90 day plan.\n\nHave them write 1st draft of their annual review and co-define what success looks like, then back into a 90 day plan (which should have been backed into from the job description)\n\nIf after 90 days not good, can cut. Double down on your stars &amp; promote within\n\nIf you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is more important than trying to fix ppl who won't create 10x value.\n\nManagement drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employees Mistakes founders make:\n\n- Hiring too senior, too soon, when they try to do big co things in a small co setting.\n\n- Hiring too senior too late is also bad b/c you got builders but you don't know what you should be building &amp; how to scale &amp; implement processes Mistake people make when hiring head of recruiting:\n\nHiring someone from FB/Google and expecting same output.\n\nFind me someone who can sell a company with no brand and less pay.\n\nEasy to sell ice cream. Hard to tell a cold hot dog.\n\nWhen hiring one, make sure they can source too. Sell a cold hot dog* When to hire a head of HR?\n\nWhen founders are spending more than 20% of their time on HR issues, then it's time to bring in a head of HR. No one cares like founders care. \n\nNo one's gonna personalize emails or sell in person like the founders will. \n\nNo one\u2019s gonna have credibility like founder does.\n\nIf you're CEO, own the function initially, while building out a process so it can eventually scale beyond you.

Globalization is both a compliment and substitute for Productivity growth.\n\nCompliment: Economies of scale. Important for any good w/ high fixed cost and low marginal cost (software)\n\nSubstitute: Opportunity cost for innovating vs copying what's already worked elsewhere goes up Globalization w/o tech breakthrough makes sense on a micro level but breaks down on macro level.\n\nIf you look at US cars per capita and extrapolate to India, that can work for India. But if you extrapolate everywhere, oil will cost $300 a barrel and we'll have a global depression The future effects of technology are hard to predict:\n\nWhen the transistor came out, people thought they'd be good for hearing aids. Why has science slowed?\n\nMany scientists had their breakthroughs in 20s.\n\nThe more advanced the state of the art is in any given field, the more of your time you have to spend just getting caught up\u2014&amp; thus you miss being able to contribute in what some ppl call your peak years. As population skews older, you have fewer people in the workforce and more people needing healthcare.\n\nOlder people are also more likely to vote (2 to 1), so politicians cater to their needs. US deficit in oil production was basically tying the global economy together.\n\nHad to keep Middle East stable, which meant had to keep everyone else stable too. US dependency on Middle East for oil was an implicit subsidy for the East Asian export driven economic success stories. Now that we are energy independent, doesn't make sense for us to intervene as much for oil.\n\nBut intervening might make sense to ensure the world is on our currency system, in our supply chains and in our cultural sphere.\n\nWar for oil was never popular. War for P&amp;G even less. What can we learn from east asian miracles?\n\nU.S. shouldn't copy blindly everything that they do anymore than they copied everything the U.S. did.\n\nBut they do prove state directed model can work, if competent.\n\nLesson: Make it high status to be in gov't so great ppl go there.

And that's living under an incompetent &amp; thoroughly honest gov't b/c at least in the 1st scenario, you can pay someone to let you do what you need to do.\" One reason why trade deficit doesn't matter as much:\n\nSince U.S. is a great place to invest in b/c of human capital, Maybe U.S. should be running a deficit because it's still the best place to put money, whether it's safe money in treasuries or risk capital in startups. China might be vulnerable:\n\nCCP derives political legitimacy from the fact that the economy is growing\n\nWhen U.S. struggles, they switch the president, but don't question democracy\n\nIf China had their own 2008, unclear it'd be the same.

Anti-tech in some sense is bi-partisan.\n\nLeft says we're concerned that people might not be getting ideas from approved sources.\n\nRight says we're don't like these techies doing drugs at Burning Man.\n\nBoth worry about 7 yr olds w/ smart phone addictions.\n\n(Caricatures of views) Response to tech-lash? \n\nCompanies get less ambitious.\n\nMicrosoft got less ambitious after anti-trust, which is partly why it missed mobile but also is least threatening of all tech giants. \n\nThe monopolies always pretend to not be monopolies. Malthus was actually correct that higher crop yields did lead to faster birth rates.\n\nWhat he didn't foresee was that the shift from manual labor to producing food led to longer career investment &amp; thus people delaying getting married until they're older (&amp; thus having less kids) Progressives &amp; Conservatives are confused.\n\nProgressives have adopted conservative puritan view that man is intrinsically sinful &amp; should subvert himself to the not sinful.\n\nConservatives have adopted progressive view that good institutions can change ppl (e.g democracy in Iraq). Progress studies itself is fundamentally agnostic. \n\nJust focused on increasing productivity, rather than asking who wins, who loses.\n\nIt's anti-partisan in the sense that partisanship tends to arise when we become less productive, that's when politics becomes more zero sum. Why we're polarized (besides slow growth)\n\nInternet means more news outlets that appeal to niche interests.\n\nSocial media means it's easy to get the propaganda you want.\n\nYou can choose media outlets that are going to outrage you in the precise way you want to be outraged. Peak California:\n\nHousing shortage means rents go up in line w/ cash comp, not equity comp, &amp; that means that incumbents have a recruiting advantage over startups.\n\nIn other words, high real estate selects against early stage companies &amp; selects for later stage companies. Stanford boiled down is an acceptance letter, a network, and a job fair at the end.\n\nYC realized you could do this in 3 months instead of 4 years\u2014and that equity was a better business model.\n\nLike Stanford, the more it succeeds, the more it becomes a monoculture. What Pinker gets wrong:\n\nThe distribution of extreme violence is such that the trailing mean is always lower than the the actual underlying mean.\n\nHe's correct about what a linear extrapolation from the historic data tells you, but wrong about the nature of that distribution. Darwinian case for monogamy:\n\nIncreases the chances that you'll be loyal to each other &amp; dedicated to their kids\u2014who are then more likely to do the same for their kids.\n\nCounter argument is that a lot of artistic and intellectual achievement doesn't come from normie families Austrian economics:\n\nBoom &amp; bust cycles don't just happen in gov't, but also in private business.\n\nThey tend to predict bubbles too early and that's why you'll tend to make more money betting on the bubble &amp; going along for the ride Lessons from Alan Greenspan:\n\nIf you want to positively impact the world, you can either have great ideas or do whatever it takes to implement them.\n\nSomeone has to do the latter, dirty work. What's the point of having brilliant theorists whose theories never get implemented? Ideal education:\n\nKids should find a topic they're passionate about, dive into it in as much depth as possible, just nerd out to the maximum extent possible, &amp; then find something else wants once they've either reached the limit of their abilities or their interest has waned Online filter bubbles are bad, but real world filter bubbles can be good.\n\nThey can be safe spaces for people who have heretical ideas to mold them until they're ready to be shared.\n\nSafe spaces for people who don't want to be merely mimetic. Equality\n\nWealth gets more unequal, but consumption gets more equal (which is why the gap btw a billionaire's life and our lives is smaller than it used to be). \n\nOvertime, wealthy end up w/ larger share of country's resources, until a war or plague and that all gets wiped out. Role of gov't &amp; wall street: \n\nCoordinate behavior at scale to pursue a distant objective.\n\nThey both coordinate a lot of behavior that is optimal when it happens in parallel, but not that useful if it happens in sequence. (E.g Apollo) Bubbles happen when some people say the price is too high, others are saying no it\u2019s early ppl will make so much money (e.g internet bubble dot com optimists were actually right).\n\nBut the ones who got optimistic at the wrong time lost a lot of money. Equity bubble\u2014The future will be very different from the present &amp; you want to own equity in that future. We all try to be different\n\nCredit bubble\u2014future will look exactly like the past only more. Ppl who owe us money will continue to service the debt. We all try to be the same Nepotism is a credit market for reputation rather than cash.\n\nLike financial banks, there are social capital \"banks\" willing to lend social capital to ppl who don't need it and not willing to risk social capital on new &amp; risky people\n\nNeed to incentivize social capital investing Social capital bubbles:\n\nIf there are just more people willing to vouch for more people, then you end up with too many bad ideas getting funded.\n\nAnd you also end up with people optimizing for getting recommended versus optimizing for building something good Social capital isn't like the economy where you can tinker w/ interest rates &amp; inflation.\n\nSo in that sense of status market is maybe analogous to the gold standard where there can be inflation and deflation and they're actually somewhat exoticness to the system My conversations w/ @ByrneHobart here:\n\nhttps://t.co/OP95Sbokvq\n\nhttps://t.co/qcDHNenO56\n\nSign up here to read more.

Customers aren't quite getting value, users are not growing quite that fast, word of mouth is not spreading, press who use it are a kind of blah, and the sales cycle takes too damn long.\" Andreessen continued:\n\nBut you can always feel it when product market fit is happening. Customers are buying as fast as you can add servers, you're hiring sales and support as fast as you can, ...money is piling up in your checking account, investors are staking out your house... Andreessen continued:\n\nDo whatever is required to get to PM-fit Including changing out ppl, rewriting product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don't want to, telling customers yes when you don't want to, raising that 4th round of dilutive VC\u2014Anything Andreessen continued:\n\nConversely, you see a surprising # of really well-run cos having all aspects of operations completely buttoned down, HR policies in place, great sales model, ... outstanding catered food, top tier VCs, heading straight off a cliff due to not finding PM-fit These are all great, but they're lagging indicators.\n\nSean Ellis found a leading indicator\u2014measure how many users would be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product.\n\nCompanies w/ over 40% often grow easily. Opposite for under.\n\nIf you have 40%, invest in growth. Survey: \n\n1/ What is it that ppl love about X?\n\n2/ What holds ppl back from falling in love w/ X?\n\nIf they love product for same reason, just find more of that user.\n\nSpend 1/2 time doubling down on what users already love about X &amp; other 1/2 on what\u2019s holding others back If you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score won\u2019t increase. \n\nIf you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you. \n\nThis insight can guide your product planning process, effectively writing your roadmap for you. Roadmap:\n\nTo stack-rank priorities, use a simple cost-impact analysis: label each potential project as low/medium/high cost, and similarly low/medium/high impact.\n\nImpact from solving held ppl back is clear from survey.\n\nImpact from doubling down on strengths is more intuitive Highest Expectation Customer (HEC):\n\nPpl who enjoy your product for its greatest benefit\n\nNo massive consumer internet brand has ever grown primarily through viral loops or viral mechanics\n\nThey also always have virality through word of mouth\n\nWhich is why HEC's are so important. Recap: \n\n1/ How would you feel if you couldn't use X? (very, somewhat, or not disappointed)\n\n2/ What ppl would benefit most from X?\n\n3/ What's main benefit you get from X?\n\n4/ How can we improve X?\n\nSend survey to ppl who've used X at least 2x in 2 weeks. ~40 responses is enough SABR:\n\n1- Segment to find supporters &amp; paint a picture of your high-expectation customers (very disappointed)\n\n2- Analyze feedback to convert on-the-fence users into fans\n\n3- Build your roadmap by doubling down on what users love and addressing what holds others back\n\n4- Repeat Ignore customers who either\n\n- wouldn't be \"very disappointed\" if X went away AND/OR\n\n- don't experience the main benefit as your high-expectation customer\n\nDo cater to the needs of customers who would be very disappointed and/or the ones who share the main benefit as your HEC. Ignoring the \"somewhat disappointed\" will be hard.\n\nThey\u2019ll request distracting features, present ill-fitting use cases &amp; be very vocal, all before they churn out and leave you with a mangled, muddled roadmap\n\nActing on their feedback will lead you astray on your quest for PM-fit Making sure you pick the right customers (&amp; keep the wrong ones out) is *critical*\n\nBy focusing on the right customers, you get more relevant feedback, you learn faster, you increase NPS, you get more word-of-mouth virality, with the community that matters most to you. PM-fit measures dependency on a product, either because there's such a strong emotional connection or because nothing else exists quite like it.\n\nNPS score measures how strong your word of mouth effect is likely to be in others.\n\nYou need both, but figure out PM-fit first. Metrics:\n\nYou don't want your churn to be more than 6-7% month to month or you're going to have a very hard time building meaningful business. \n\nFor a single player subscription tool, 2-3% month to month is great Is this a full proof plan to PM-fit? Not exactly.\n\n3 reasons why companies may fail even w/ PM-fit engine:\n\n1- Running out of money before they finish this process. \n\n2- Co-founders breaking up.\n\n3- Giving up. \n\nIf PM-fit score is 5-15%, Rahul recommends reconsidering the product Pricing: \n\n1- Understand competitive environment. \n\n2- Come up w/ positioning \n\n3- Develop pricing \n\nAsk your target users four questions:\n\n1- At what $ would you consider X to be so expensive that you wouldn't consider buying it? Pricing: \n\n2- At what price would you consider X to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn't be very good? \n\n3- At what price would you consider X to be getting expensive? \n\n4- At what price is X a bargain?\n\nOnly lower price if land-grab or 1st-mover advantage On launching:\n\nReid Hoffman: \"If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.\"\n\nThis applies to startups creating new markets, esp w/ network effects (LinkedIn, Airbnb)\n\nIn existing markets w/ great products, bar is different (E.g Notion) On launch:\n\n\u201cA startup should only launch for one of three reasons: \n\n1- You need more users or customers to sell to. \n\n2- You need more capital to spend. \n\n3- You need more candidates to hire.\u201d /FIN\n\nI also recorded a podcast w/ @rahulvohra and @toddg777 about their new angel fund, and other company-building topics.\n\nhttps://t.co/lypbaW3g5t "}, {"thread": "Aggregated threads on company building, including:\n\n- How to pick startup ideas\n- Picking co-founders\n- How to raise a seed round\n- Recruiting\n- Hiring execs\n- Management\n- Growth\n- Network effects\n- Building communities\n- Remote How to pick startup ideas: https://t.co/RMFUUyGdnw How to pick co-founders: https://t.co/YKmp8w8Mor How to raise a seed round: https://t.co/smosXR0KkX Recruiting: https://t.co/vE3BJdFckM Management: https://t.co/TJzRYDdBE1 Growth: https://t.co/1n1ZvUVshw Building network effects: https://t.co/aSbMdwX2qW Remote: https://t.co/LQqSk0Y1nU Hiring execs: https://t.co/lkSGHxUQoA Building communities : https://t.co/V0zJeewl6v Importnat skill for a founder: https://t.co/nurNaYNCcx "}, {"thread": "What's your favorite single podcast episode that you don't think many other people (including myself) have heard?\n\nLooking for some hidden gems...

Functional institutions are the exception, not the norm.\n\nSociety flourishes by having functional institutions\n\nGreat Founder Theory focuses on how great founders create (or rebuild) functional institutions that enable (sustained) flourishing A functional institution can outright solve a problem for a civilization. \n\nIt might, for example, complete the construction of infrastructure so important it changes the course of economic development for centuries to come, such as ancient China\u2019s grand canal or...solving COVID. \"Like many things, people\u2019s impact on the world follows a Pareto-like distribution, with the most impactful people having a far greater impact than the rest.\n\nThe creation of functional institutions is the means by which people are hugely impactful.\" It's easier to start from scratch than to rebuild from within.\n\nInstitutions often resist change, and diagnosing dysfunction is hard, as it usually has many causes\n\nThis explains Thiel\u2019s law: a founder\u2019s best shot at creating a functional institution is to get it from the start. Live &amp; Dead players:\n\nA live player is a person or a tightly coordinated group of people that is able to innovate (startup mentality).\n\nA dead player is a person or a group of people that is working off a script, incapable of doing new things. (incumbent mentality) Understanding a player is dead means you can replace them without much of a fight.\n\nUnderstanding a player is live means you can collaborate with them and you should be mindful of their path to power\n\nTo revive a dead player, you have to displace an existing power structure What happens to institution when great founder dies?\n\nSuccession challenge.\n\nPower succession: Who takes over\n\nSkill succession: How do they gain the skills.\n\nRome solved this by \"adopting\" someone early and ensuring their training If the succession problem is unsolved, the only process of institutional reform is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as creative destruction.\n\nThat we praise this process indicates we've resigned ourselves to failed succession. We should temper our enthusiasm for intense political and economic competition and instead develop a greater appreciation for the importance of successful succession. \n\nThis change would go far in remedying contemporary institutional sclerosis and stagnation. The purpose of a bureaucracy is to save the time of a competent person.\n\nPut another way: to save time, some competent people will create a system that is meant to do exactly what they want \u2014 nothing more and nothing less Create a bureaucracy when you are both \n\n(a) trying to do something that you do not have the capacity to do on your own, and \n\n(b) unable to find a competent, aligned person to handle the project for you. \n\nBureaucracies ameliorate the problem of talent and alignment scarcity. Bureaucrats are expected to act according to a script, or a set of procedures \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\n\nOwners don\u2019t trust that bureaucrats will be competent or aligned enough to act in line with the owner\u2019s wishes of their own accord.\n\nIf low trust, minimize downside (&amp; thus cap upside) Other methods of accomplishing goals:\n\nIf you have access to a delegate (i.e someone you trust), don\u2019t treat them like a bureaucrat. \n\nA delegate can perform tasks you didn\u2019t know needed doing and build aligned systems beyond your design, a bureaucrat cannot. Status is a coordination mechanism\u2014the relative respect &amp; patterns of deference accorded to people, groups &amp; organizations by wider society.\n\nDispersing it wisely decreases friction for certain high impact people to team up and work on certain high impact projects (&amp; vice versa). Celebration of such people isn\u2019t merely a personal reward. \n\nIt is how we replenish this social capital, which in turn powers the social fabric that enables these people to do what they do. \n\nWithout it, you can\u2019t go to space. (e.g. Elon helping make space cool &amp; feasible) Dispersing status is one of the most important roles of the ruler\u2014\n\nThe ruler uses his prestige to regulate overall status, so that the right people &amp; the right behaviors win, solving coordination problems &amp; tragedies of the commons.\n\nGlory is a better motivator than money. intellectual dark matter: knowledge we cannot see publicly, but whose existence we can infer because our institutions would fly apart if the knowledge we see were all there was.\n\nThe danger of copying:\n\nOnce a tradition is lost, you are making photocopies of photocopies. Each subsequent copy loses information. \n\nA crucial difference between organisms &amp; organizations is that organizations do not undergo natural selection. \n\nSince the fidelity of transmitting intricate social technologies is so low, complex adaptations cannot arise. Lost knowledge: Just as physicists are only able to observe 15% of matter in existence, today we possess written fragments from only 13% of the ~2,000 known ancient Greek \n\nMuch of our foundational knowledge was built on that ~13% Imagine how much we'd have if we'd found more? Tacit knowledge is knowledge that's not transmitted in writing. \n\ne.g. a blacksmith learns to craft well-balanced swords through direct practice and correction from a master \u2014 not by reading a textbook.\n\nMy 4/1 assist to turnover ratio in pick up b-ball\u2014you can't teach that.

Signalling\n\nSignalling saves you from violence, but it means you're effectively BS-ing your way through life A good way of getting your way is using any means necessary to convince others, even deceiving.\n\nThis means you're often looking out for others deceiving you.\n\nThe best way to deceive is to not lie.\n\nBelieve your own bullshit so deeply that you don\u2019t produce any sign of cheating.

That's more or less it\n\nIt's not a receptacle for or the origin of your thoughts, it's a tool. Truth is hard.\n\nNot only are you deceiving yourself all the time to raise your status, but other people are also deceiving you all the time  to raise theirs too.\n\nSo of course being able to manipulate your peers is more important than being able to correctly understand truth. People\u2019s statements are just signals in a long-standing status competition.\n\nKevin Simler and Robin Hanson wrote an entire book on this: https://t.co/NpLkkJw7mA\n\nConflict theory &amp; mistake theory get at two ways to address this: https://t.co/Lc9Z5CMWoc To be sure, Some people do get status from pursuing truth (scientists, writers, academics)\n\nThe more truth they pursue, the more status they get, b/c they're great at it.\n\nBut most people aren't good enough to gain any status from truth-discovery, so they refrain from pursuing it Why would we be evolved for truth?\n\nIt takes time and effort, and it's not necessary\n\nTruth is often inconvenient for status\n\nIt's more effective to believe self-serving BS\n\nChange the rules of the game. When they go truth, you go BS\n\nWhatever you gotta do to survive &amp; reproduce.

People get depressed hearing this, but the deception is not all bad; sometimes you want to hide things.\n\nThe whole concept of \"status\" altogether is a problematic truth, which is why we rarely acknowledge it explicitly and certainly resist making it legible to the internet.\n\nWhy? Genetical survival is often zero-sum, and even when it isn't, competition for mates is zero-sum.\n\nThis is a hard truth to coordinate around (that humans are inherently in conflict) \n\nSo we hide the idea of status &amp; pursue it secretly &amp; subconsciously, deceiving all along the way.

(e.g housing in 2008) The initial supply shock is similar to trade war last year.\n\nWhen there's a disruption to manufacturing supply chains, that tends to reduce business investment, which puts downward pressure on demand for credit, which (usually) reduces equilibrium interest rates. Also, w/ COVID, there's also a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. \n\nAnd when there's uncertainty, there's a rush for safe assets, people buy treasury bonds, that also puts downward pressure on interest rates. \n\nSo you have this downward pressure on global interest rates. You can think of the equilibrium rate as the rate consistent w/ stable economic growth &amp; consistent w/ the feds targets for inflation &amp; employment.\n\nIf the Fed sets its policy rate too high or too low, we go off track\n\nThis makes ppl think Fed should do nothing, but it's untrue Doing nothing is doing something\n\nIf you want money supply or interest rates to be the same as before, you have to do something to get it there\n\nif velocity slows, to maintain the same monetary policy, you have to increase money supply to offset effects on declining velocity B/c the dollar plays a large role in the global economy, changes in US monetary policy have ripple effects on other countries.\n\nIf Fed doesn't cut rates fast enough, monetary policy gets unintentionally tighter. Side effect of tighter money is the dollar appreciates in fx market. This also happened in the second half of 2008 during the financial crisis:\n\nThe dollar appreciated strongly, and for countries where their currencies are linked to the dollar &amp; that have borrowed a lot of money in dollars, this can become a very big burden. What should Fed do if it becomes a global financial crisis?\n\nTactics:\n\nIn 2008, the Fed extended a number of currency swap lines to a number of central banks across the world. Prob same again\n\nCutting interest rates, QE to address immediate crisis for liquidity, need for stimulus Strategy:\n\nGDP level targeting, but that's unrealistic, so instead level targeting of inflation. \n\nLevel targeting, as opposed to just inflation targeting, forces Fed to be much more serious.\n\nIf Fed overestimates inflation, they actually have to make up for past mistakes Many central banks have had excessively contractionary monetary policy, which has led to inflation &amp; growth not hitting their target.\n\nLow inflation &amp; low growth puts pressure on interest rates\n\nAs interest rates fall, ppl think central banks have easy monetary policy. Which is why people think there aren't many levers for monetary policy. But that's wrong. These low interest rates (&amp; QE) are really a reflection of previous tight money\n\nWe have to ask ourselves two questions: 1/ what kind of target do we want for inflation or nominal GDP growth? \n\nThe higher the target, the higher the interest rate, &amp; the less QE you'll have to do, b/c ppl won't want to hold as much cash\n\nWant low inflation rate? (e.g. Japan, Switzerland) Do QE b/c ppl will hoard cash 2/ Are we going to tell central banks to do whatever it takes to hit their inflation / growth targets?\n\nOr would we rather give this to fiscal policy?\n\nMonetary policy is less costly b/c it neither adds to our national debt nor puts a big tax burden on future generations Also less costly than fiscal policy b/c if the Fed buys a lot of assets, usually it will make a profit (they did in 2008)\n\nBut even if they make a modest loss, that loss is going to be a much smaller burden on future taxpayers than fiscal stimulus would be Maybe there's a chance that, if interest rates fell to zero and they couldn't be cut any further, they Fed could widen the range of assets (e.g. Treasury securities, corporate bonds) they could buy wide enough such that they'd have enough assets to hit a 2% inflation target. We keep seesawing but each time is better than before.\n\nOverreacted on expansionary side in 60s/70s\n\nIn last decade, overreacted on contractionary side\n\nBut 2008 was much better recovery than 1929.\n\nFed should be more responsive to market conditions than Phillips Curve models In conclusion: Desired response is level targeting, ideally of GDP but inflation level targeting will do.\n\nAdditionally, Fed should cut interest rate target b/c I believe equilibrium interest rate has fallen, but cutting interest rates without level targeting isn't enough.

Adler says choose our lives &amp; our lifestyles\" Freud\u2019s idea is that a person\u2019s psychic wounds (traumas) cause their present unhappiness. \n\nWhen you treat a person\u2019s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality &amp; sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive. But Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: \u201cNo matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.\u201d That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.\" He isn't saying that the experience of a calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong.\n\nBut he's saying we can determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences \"If I stay in my room all the time, without ever going out, I can get all of my parents\u2019 special attention focused on me. \n\nOn the other hand, if I take even one step out of the house, I\u2019ll just become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. No longer special.\" To quote Adler: \u201cThe important thing is not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.\u201d \n\nYou want to be Y or someone else because you are utterly focused on what you were born with. \n\nInstead, you\u2019ve got to focus on what you can make of your equipment. A person wants to be a novelist, but never seems to complete his work. \n\nHe wants to leave the possibility of \u201cI can do it if I try\u201d open, by not committing to anything. \n\nIf he tried and failed, he'd shut the door to that. Many things are like this: invented stories to never try All problems stem from interpersonal relationships; (all joys stem from interpersonal relationship.)\n\nIf you can just be by yourself, you\u2019ll even have a justification ready whenever other people snub you.\n\nThat if you didn't have your shortcomings, you too could be loved. Anger is a form of communication, and communication is possible without using anger. \n\nWe can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for anger. \n\nIf you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all on its own. Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. \n\nIt leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise me, I won\u2019t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I\u2019ll engage in inappropriate actions, too. \u201cFreedom is being disliked by other people.\u201d \n\nThe courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. \n\n(Don't be a jerk but:) \u201cYou have enemies? Good. It means you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d - Churchill \"My father was a moody person. But to blame him for why our relationship went bad is Freudian etiology.\n\nThe Adlerian teleology reverses the cause-and-effect interpretation.\n\ne.g. I brought out the memory of his badness b/c I don\u2019t want my relationship w/ my father to get better\" \"That\u2019s right. For me, it was more convenient to not repair my relationship with my father. I could use having a father like that as an excuse for why my own life wasn\u2019t going well. That for me was a virtue.

When one adopts the POV of Freud, one sees life as a great big story based on cause and effect. \n\nSo it's all about where and when I was born, what my childhood was like, the school I attended and the company where I got a job. \n\nThat decides who I am now and who I will become. For Adler, You're not bound by the past. Life isn't a linear narrative. \n\nLife isn't like climbing a mountain. You are not \"en route\". \n\nIt's more like a series of dots/moments. \"Here and now\"\n\nLive like you're dancing: you're enjoying the moment but also going somewhere.

The tragedy is that these luxury beliefs are originated by the elites, who get the benefits of short-term high status, but the long-term costs are ultimately borne by the masses.\n\nIt'd be as if the masses bought a ton of expensive shit they didn't need &amp; became saddled w/ debt. Polyamory is an example, popularized by the affluent who often end up in monogamous relationships after flirting w/ polyamory.\n\nThe elites are in a better position to experiment since they can afford protection (&amp; abortion if needed) &amp; can recover thx to financial/social capital.

Postmodernism is anti-realist, holding that it is impossible to speak meaningfully about an independently existing reality. \n\nHaving done this, postmodernism denies that reason or any other method is means of acquiring objective knowledge of that reality. Postmodern accounts of human nature are collectivist, holding that individuals\u2019 identities are constructed largely by the social-linguistic groups that they are a part of.\n\nThese groups are consistently in conflict, and those conflicts are resolved by force (masked or naked) Post modern cultural debates:\n\n- Columbus modern hero or imperialist?\n- is USA &amp; the west broadly progressive on liberalism or an oppressor?\n- Is technology net positive?\n- is liberalism universal? \n- Should people be treated as individuals or as groups? \n\nhttps://t.co/FAPDQxmBu1 What makes these conflicts post-modern? That the terms have shifted.\n\n\u201cTruth\u201d is a myth. \u201cReason\u201d is a white male Eurocentric construct. \u201cEquality\u201d is a mask for oppressions. \u201cPeace\u201d and \u201cProgress\u201d are met w/ reminders of power.\n\nFar left &amp; far right are converging.\n\nSmithsonian: https://t.co/kiZ8SMujCl How did post-modernism come about? Hicks traces the history by starting w/ Kant.\n\nKant asserted that people couldn't perceive reality outside of the mind. It was all subjective.\n\nTo speak of truth as an external relationship between mind and reality is nonsense, Kant claimed Of the five major features of Enlightenment reason\u2014objectivity, competence, autonomy, universality, and being an individual faculty\u2014Kant rejects objectivity. \n\nOnce reason is so severed from reality, the rest is\ndetails\u2014details that are worked out over the next two centuries. After Kant it was Hegel.\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s focused on epistemology, Hegel\u2019s focused on  metaphysics. \n\n- Reality is subjective and has contradictions\n- Since reality evolves contradictorily, truth is relative to time &amp; place\n- The collective, not the individual, is the operative unit The postmodernists abandoned Hegel's metaphysics * put Nietzschean power struggles at the core of our being. \n\nAnd especially in the cases of Foucault &amp; Derrida, most postmodernists abandoned Nietzsche \u2019s sense of the exalted potential of man &amp; embraced Heidegger\u2019s anti-humanism. Note this was a 180 for the far left:\n\nSocialism accepted evidence, reason, logic, tolerance, and civility. \n\nIt was only when socialism performed so badly that those tools became enemies, because they were no longer useful to furthering socialism. Socialists argued that capitalism was driven by a logic of competitive exploitation that would cause its eventual collapse and that socialism\u2019s communal form of production, by contrast, would prove to be economically superior.\n\nThey hoped for an eventual class war that never came Morally, capitalism was evil both because of the self-interested motives of those engaged in competition and b/c  of the exploitation and alienation that competition caused.\n\nSocialism, by contrast, would be based on selfless sacrifice and communal sharing.\n\n...This didn't happen So reason had nothing to offer the far-left.\n\nWhat mattered now was will, authentic, and non-rational commitment.\n\nMarxism failed. Class was not strong enough binder to foment a revolution. So the left rebranded to focusing on identity groups, which were more binding &amp; permanent https://t.co/oQ7sP5jkyy If one is interested in truth , then one\u2019s rational response to a failing theory is as follows:\n\n- Break down theory into its premises, question them vigorously and check the logic that integrates them.\n- Seek out alternatives\n- Accept moral responsibility for consequences. But they'd rather throw out truth altogether.\n\nEchoing Dostoyevski, \"If the truth was outside of Christ,\nI would rather remain with Christ than with the truth.\u201d\n\nBoth religion and socialism started with a comprehensive\nvision that they believed to be true but not based on reason Post-modernists are the new sophists.\n\nThe Sophists taught rhetoric not as a means of advancing truth and knowledge but as a means of winning\ndebates in the rough-and-tumble world of day-to-day politics. Coming after two millennia of Christianity and two centuries of socialist theory\u2014post modernists believe that  Subjectivism and relativism are true, except\nthat the postmodernists are on the side of the weaker and\nhistorically-oppressed groups. Consider the following claims. \n\nOn the one hand, all truth is relative; on the other hand, postmodernism tells it like it really is. \n\nOn the one hand, all cultures are equally deserving of respect; on the other, Western culture is uniquely destructive and bad. (Cont):\n\nTechnology is bad and destructive\u2014and it is unfair that some people have more than others. \n\nTolerance is good and dominance is bad\u2014but when postmodernists come to power, thought police follows.\n\nSubjectivism and relativism in one breath, dogmatic absolutism in the next.

The future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. Libertarian utopia.\n\nFast-forward to 2019. The status quo has swung back to 1969. The era of globalization improved living standards by making labor and goods cheaper, but also hurt living standards through increased competition for limited resources. Free-trade advocates tend to think that the first effect dominates the second. When you talk about AI as the last computing device where you\u2019re building a mind that can outthink &amp; outwit any human being, you end up with these very scary &amp; political questions: Is it going to be friendly? Is it dangerous? \n\nNot, what is this going to do to unemployment? The Google propaganda is that we have runaway technological progress many people will be left behind, and we need to take care of them. \n\nThis doesn't show up in any of the data. We have 3.5% unemployment and the productivity numbers are still anemic. The data point people always give is self-driving cars. \n\nEven if you got them, it might replace at most 1 percent of the workforce, it might increase productivity by a few percent in the economy. \n\nIf you phased them in over a decade, it would not be that transformative. We've actually had *less* automation. \n\nkindergarten teachers, nurses, yoga instructors, all these sort of nontradeable service sector jobs are fairly immune to automation. If we had this sort of runaway automation, you could get to 3%, 4% GDP growth, and at 3% to 4% GDP growth, we can solve these problems socially.\n\nThen there will be a lot more room for various social programs\n\nIf automation's happening, then we'll see in the productivity numbers And, given sufficient automation, then eventually maybe we need something like UBI. If automation is not happening and you do UBI, then you just blow up the economy. \n\nEven a Marxist thinks you have to first get the capitalists to do things before you can redistribute stuff. We\u2019re not allowed to develop new drugs with the FDA charging $1.3 billion per new drug. \n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to fly supersonic jets because they\u2019re too noisy. \n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to build nuclear power plants.\n\nWe've outlawed the world of atoms, so ppl focus on bits. If you give me a choice of getting rid of the vast bulk of government regulations &amp; keeping the Fed, I\u2019d much rather do that than keeping all the other zoning laws &amp; crazy rules we have and going with PayPal, Bitcoin, gold, any sort of alternate currency one could come up with. Why did brilliant people in the Soviet Union become grandmaster chess players? They weren\u2019t allowed to do anything else.\u2028\n\nSame with why so many brilliant rocket scientists went into wall street, because they couldn't use their skills due to overregulation. It\u2019s hard to remember this, but gov't was once high tech, too: The Apollo program put a man on the moon.  \n\nBut today our government is broken. Our newest fighter jets can\u2019t even fly in the rain.\n\nThat is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan project. Science has gotten dramatically worse, by being a victim of its own success.\n\nWe poured money on it, which politicized the system. But a great scientist is the opposite of a good politician. A scientist is someone who pursues truth. A politician manipulates truth. So we miss out. A lot of innovators discovered things, but weren\u2019t able to get anything. \n\nTesla was out-competed by Edison, even though Edison had an inferior technology. \n\nThe Wright brothers came up with the first airplane, but they didn\u2019t get to be rich.\n\nEinstein discovered relativity--nada When were the last political speeches you can remember where people in very concrete terms portrayed a future that looks very different from the present? \n\nGorbachev: \u201cTear down that wall\"\n\nWe've gotten more vague: \"Hope and Change\"\n\nIt didn't do well. People are scared of change The 1990s narrative was the new economy, and they lied about growth.\n\nAnd then the 2000s narrative was the Great Moderation, and they lied about volatility.\n\nAnd maybe the 2010s one is secular stagnation, where they lie about the real interest rates, b/c the other two don't work. Why the slowdown?\n\nIs it an external reality that\u2019s made it hard or is it something in the culture that\u2019s changed that makes us less ambitious?\n\nCulture. We\u2019re often too biased to go to the natural explanation b/c it\u2019s one that exonerates us from responsibility for the slowdown Extreme optimism &amp; extreme pessimism are both equally wrong. \n\nWe should always come back to the question of individual agency and it's not these large historic forces. \n\nThere's always room for history, for new ideas, and these things are never definitively decided either way. Think a lot harder about the future...try to think concretely what you want to do...there's always a question, where is the frontier, where are some pockets of innovation where you can do some new things and not be in a crazed competition.\n\n3 possible technological frontiers: Cyberspace:  The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. \n\nThe limitation of the Internet is that these new worlds are virtual and that any escape may be more imaginary than real. \n\nStill TBD. Outer space: Because the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics. \n\nBut we are still ways away from being ready for this. Seasteading: Between cyberspace &amp; outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans. \n\nThe tech involved is more tentative than the Internet, but more realistic than space travel. \n\nWe may have reached the stage at which it will soon be economically feasible.

Both failed. At the time it wasn't obvious liberal democracies were superior. \n\nThe U.S. lasted only 90 years before it plunged into a brutal Civil War. \n\nIn the 1920s the U.S. is itself experiencing economic uncertainty and is shortly to plunge into its Great Depression. Nazism is collectivistic: it does not hold that individuals have their own lives to live and happiness to pursue. Rather, individuals should serve the general good, to which they subordinate their personal lives\n\nNazism tried to reconcile nationalism and socialism. the Nazis rejected cosmopolitanism, an ideal of Western liberals who believe that all humans are essentially the same wherever one travels in the world, and who believe that one should strive to be a citizen of the world. \n\nThe Nazis are nationalists, by contrast. The message was quite clear: You are not a private individual seeking profit or higher wages in a capitalist economy. You and your property belong in trust to the German people, and you have a duty to serve the public interest, even if it involves a personal sacrifice. That human beings are divided into collective groups that shape their identity. \n\nThat those collective groups are in a life and death competitive struggle with each other. \n\nThat any tactic is legitimate in the war of competing groups. That human beings are not individuals with their own lives to live but are servants of the state. \n\nThat the state should have total power over both the minds and bodies of its citizens and may dispose of them as If you believe wholeheartedly and passionately that your identity is found by merging yourself with your group\u2014* that your group is locked in a mortal, zero-sum conflict w/ other groups\u2014&amp; that reason is superficial &amp; that passion &amp; instinct drive the world\u2014what does that portend? Thinkers associated w/ revolutions:\n\nCommunist in Russia &amp; China - Marx\nFrench - Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nAmerican - John Locke\nNazi - Hegel, Fichte, some Marx, but mostly Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche was a nineteenth-century German philosopher famous for his worship of human potential &amp; for encouraging individuals to seek great heights &amp; make real their creative dreams. He is also famous for his absolute loathing of all things small, cowardly, or mediocre. For fans of Nietzsche, the idea that God is dead galvanizes every fiber of their being. They respond by feeling, both passionately &amp; solemnly: I will become the author. I will create. I will embrace the responsibility\u2014joyously. I will move beyond good and evil &amp; create new values Both religion and socialism thus glorify weakness and need. \n\nBoth recoil from the world as it is: tough, unequal, harsh. \n\nBoth flee to an imaginary future realm where they can feel safe. \n\nAnd both desperately seek someone to look after them\u2014whether it be God or the State. And where, asks Nietzsche, are the men of courage? Who is willing to stare into the abyss? Who can look a tiger in the eye without flinching? Every generation produces its   people who accept easily that life is brutal, but assert their strength to meet the challenge. The more we look at history, the more we are struck by the diversity of circumstances &amp; how dramatically beliefs about values have changed across time. \n\nWe once prized power &amp; looked down upon the humble and &amp; meek. Now the meek are the \u201cgood guys\u201d while the aggressive are \u201cevil We went from: \n\n- Be ambitious and bold, and seek your highest dream.\n- Seek great challenges, pleasures, &amp; go your own way in life\n- And when you accomplish something great, admire yourself for what you have done and indulge yourself in the rewards that greatness deserves. To: \n\n- The meek shall inherit the earth, and blessed are the poor. \n- Instead of seeking profit, one should sacrifice and give to charity. \n- Be aware of one\u2019s weaknesses and sins, and be ashamed and self-deprecating as a result. This has led to rise in Democracy. \n\nDemocracies tailor their policies to the majority\u2014not to the exceptional few who are radicals, trailblazers, and uncompromising risk-takers. But according to Nietzsche, the modern democracy itself based on this great inversion described above. Nietzsche also credits the Judeo-Christian tradition for its spiritual development\u2014its ability to focus inward &amp; stress self-discipline.\n\nHe wants to combine the physical vitality of the aristocratic masters w/ the spiritual ruthlessness of Christianity.\n\nCeasar w/ soul of Christ Nietzsche holds that reason is an artificial tool of weaklings\u2014those who need to feel safe and secure build fantasy orderly structures for themselves. \n\nInstead, instincts are the deepest parts of your nature\u2014and when you feel them strongly, nurture them and manifest them. Nietzsche views on Jews are often misappropriated.\n\nHe did blame them (&amp; Christians) for the great inversion valuing the weak over the strong, subverting greatness in his view\n\nHe still admires how well they've both prospered despite this and flourished amid the great inversion. Differences between Nietzsche and the Nazis: \n\n1.\u00a0 Nietzsche did not believe any race was superior. \n2. Nietzsche did not think Germans were culturally superior.\n3.\u00a0Nietzsche wasn't Anti-Semitic . \n4. Nietzsche saw strong parallels between Judaism and Christianity Similarities between Nietzsche &amp; the Nazis: \n\n1. Both were strongly collectivistic\n2. Both saw see zero-sum conflict as inescapable and as fundamental to the human condition. \n3. Both downplay reason &amp; prize instincts\n4. Both are anti-democratic, anti capitalistic, &amp; anti-liberal The Nazis stood for collectivism. The opposite of that is a philosophy of individualism that recognizes individual rights.\n\nThe Nazis stood for instinct as one\u2019s basic guides in life. The opposite of that is a philosophy that has a healthy confidence in the power of reason. After detailing the atrocities of the Nazis as well as the underlying philosophies of the Nazi party (and contrasting them with Nietzsche's philosophies), Hicks ends the book provocatively:\n\n\"The Nazis knew what they stood for.

We go to war over these disagreements\n\nSo, liberalism privileges individual rights as to help us collaborate when no one agrees Liberalism has evolved over time.\n\nInitially the emphasis was mainly on \"negative rights\" (free speech, due process).\n\nThen it evolved to \"positive rights\" (e.g. equality)\n\nNegative rights are positive sum, positive rights not so much.\n\nMore context: https://t.co/kig6uUPlfW Tenets of nationalism:\n\n- You're born into a social group called a nation.\n- Each nation should have its own state.\n- Each state should have its own sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nNationalism is more powerful than civilizations.\n\nThere used to be broader empires, but no more.

That value system is the only thing that's not diverse about liberalism's aims.\n\nNationalism is about sovereignty. This is our people, our land, our rules, etc This leads liberalism to want to spread universally, as that is the best way to operate.\n\nThis ruffles nationalists who want sovereignty &amp; self-determination.\n\nLiberalism praise rights and universalism above all.

Gotta be something else. Two kinds of checks on population growth, positive &amp; negative.\n\nPositive checks are things that kill people (e.g. war, famine, disease)\n\nNegative checks are things that slow birth rate (e.g. when people get poorer, they tend to marry less and have less kids) Interestingly, once there are downswings in population, it takes a bit before they rise again\n\nThere's another process involved that leads to extended downswings: Elite Overproduction\n\nBacking up: When there are too many people, food is scarce, but jobs too, causing wages to fall A fall in wages are bad for workers, but good for elites: they can hire more workers for the same amount of $.\n\nWhen elites are better off, they are likely to marry earlier &amp; have bigger families\n\nSo when ordinary people are struggling due to overpopulation, the elite is booming. So the amount of elites take up a bigger fraction of overall population.\n\nThe problem w/ this expansion of the elite is that society only has room for a certain amount.\n\nAs the elite expands, there's growing pressure to find roles for them, so that they can keep their lifestyles. The state steps in to provide the excess elite with positions appropriate for their status.\n\nAnd that of course costs money because they need salaries sufficient to support elite lifestyles.\n\nA huge increase in # of elites means huge increase in govt expenses to fill these roles. As the elite continues to expand and the state struggles to find roles for them all, you get an intense competition for these positions.\n\nMany elites lose out on $ &amp; status they expected to get, making them very angry and leading them to turn on each other in intra-elite conflict A visible sign of this is an emphasis on credentialing.\n\nIn the old days when most of the elite youth could expect to inherit their parents wealth &amp; status, they didn't bother to go to university. \n\nBut w/ over-expansion, they now fight for credentials to separate them. Overpopulation isn't the only way we get an expansion of elite.\n\nThe American Dream is another way, the idea that anyone can earn their way to the elite.\n\nGlobalization amplifies this significantly.\n\nThe internet even more so. Now the whole world is competing to be an elite. Revolutions don't occur b/c masses are poor &amp; angry.\n\nThe elite control the army, so they can keep down the masses.\n\nRevolutions occur when there's intra elite competition.\n\nLeading to a counter elite, who, feeling entitled to $ they won't get, want to ensure others won't either. If you want to explain when social breakdowns occur, you need to look at 3 things (Political Stress Index):\n\n1- Mass mobilization potential (food shortages and falling wages)\n\n2- Elite mobilization potential (over-expansion and competition for status) \n\n3-  State fiscal distress More on state fiscal distress: \n\nAs state needs to spend more on elite, it has a hard time raising taxes b/c poor are also needy.\n\nIt can't afford to keep the elite happy and alleviate hunger and suppress unrest, and these problems of funding the state contribute to its collapse. To summarize:\n\nPopulation expands until it reaches the Malthusian limit.\n\nThis means wages fall &amp; labor is cheap, which leads to high mass mobilization potential.\n\nOverpopulation also leads to elite over-expansion and thus intra-elite competition. This leads to increased state expenditure to take care of elites, which means they need to raise taxes at the same time that the masses are poorer and *they* also need more govt services\n\nIt ends in breakdown &amp; population collapse, taking you back to underpopulation &amp; small elite Peter Turchin has also written a book applying the theory to the United States. American Civil War fits this theory\n\nStructural Demographic Theory used to take 2 centuries, but now takes 150 years, which means U.S. is getting pretty close to political breakdown &amp; social calamity. This analysis may seem strange.\n\nIsn't it a problem that rich people (&amp; everyone) are having too *few* kids? \n\nThe bigger problem is that productivity growth isn't rising enough to support their growth relative to overall population growth. Humans landed on the moon 50 yrs ago. But spaceflight remains a marginal activity with just a few astronauts in space at a time. \n\nCompare that w/ how in 50 yrs you went from the first powered aircraft to a global airline industry, already carrying 10s of millions of ppl a year. If we had continued to develop spaceflight and lunar exploration, that would have created lots of jobs, as well as opened up new resources, including abundant solar energy and metals and other valuable materials on the moon. And that would have absorbed the increase in population Signals of elite overexpansion: University attendance.\n\nIn UK since 1990, population increased by 15%, but the # of students increased by almost 100%.\n\nin 1990, American Law school grads had even distribution of salaries, but by 2000 there was a separation into winners &amp; losers. Both far leftists &amp; far rightists comprise the counter-elite.\n\nThey consider themselves entitled to elite privileges, but the state can't absorb them. \n\nAnd since they seem destined to remain outside privilege, oppose it: If they can't be a part of it, they want to destroy it. Because the cycle isn't over yet, we should expect a full blown political crisis, &amp; then a general breakdown and reset.\n\nEither a positive check (increase in death rate) and/or a negative check (decrease in birth rate)\n\nOne solution is economic growth: https://t.co/ghXx8nq8Dc https://t.co/tiHgVcsidm "}, {"thread": "Some takeaways from conversations w/ @jasoncrawford, @ArtirKel, and @Ben_Reinhardt on progress, particularly on how 1) funding models, 2) regulation, and 3) culture influence progress \ud83d\udc47 1- Funding Models:\n\nThere are a lot of different funding models (NIH grants, DARPA...)\n\nA lot of research is done in universities, yet it's a relatively new phenomenon.\n\nThere was a golden era for corporate research w/ Bell Labs &amp; Xerox, but then &amp; gov't stepped in. The US famously doesn't have a national coordinated innovation policy. \n\nIn some ways this is a good thing, since means there is more diversity of thought and funding, more opportunities for someone to say \"yes\" to scientists and fund their projects. That said, some people believe our funding sources (e.g. NIH) have become way too centralized, &amp; if we could have just more decentralized versions, we'd have more creativity\n\nBeyond decentralization, need uncorrelated work to maximize chances of discovery\n\nhttps://t.co/zfVAGyXQcO It might be better to break down the NIH into smaller units, or distribute more who makes decisions over the money.\n\nWithout competition between different approaches, how would we know what works best?\n\nOne man's nonsense might be the building block for tomorrow man's cancer cure Think of it as a few tiny Manhattan Projects, maybe 20-200M$ each, way bigger than an academic grant and potentially fundable by philanthropists.\n\nPeople in these orgs wouldn't just aim to publish papers or get tenure, but they'd have specific goals and well-defined metrics. At the same time, it's nice to have the idea of \"no-strings attached\" to enable people to take risks in research without fear of. looking dumb.\n\nImagine scientists getting funded to do anything they want for the next 10 years, no matter what. Problem: scientists spend up to 50% of their time applying for grants\n\nFast Grants seem to show that it is possible to go fast while funding high quality research\n\nUltimately money has to come from somewhere, and any incentives have tradeoffs\n\nhttps://t.co/3URA9RaeSG B/c at the end of the day, we want funding mechanisms to be fair and accountable.\n\nBut anytime you have a fair and accountable process,\nthere's there's going to be a lot of paperwork and diligence  that needs to go along with it as well as gameifiable metrics . If we could change anything about academia?\n\n- Get rid of peer review\n- Get rid of accountability around grants\n- Get rid of departments\n- Get rid of administrators\n- Breaking research out of academia\n\nIf this is controversial, blame @Ben_Reinhardt not me.  :P 2: Regulation\n\nWe've accumulated a bureaucratic, regulatory state\n\nAny time there's a disaster, we start adding rules\n\nThe intent is good, but the cure's sometimes worse than the disease\n\nFast forward 100 years after FDA, &amp; now it costs well over $1B to develop a successful drug Anecdotally, China seems to regulate technologies several years after introducing them\n\nWhat if we did the same?\n\nWe'll regulate technologies, but we need to actually see what their effects are first\n\nWe'll thoroughly warn customers of risks etc, but let them opt in or out of it If you look at the history of technology, most technologies came with new risks; most of them needed new safety mechanisms to be invented with it.\n\nWhen we invented the X-ray, for example we also realized it could be harmful for our health. Safety concerns are real, but we need to understand there are always tradeoffs to regulation. \n\nWe need to acknowledge that there is a tradeoff between safety and speed, efficiency, progress, and long term breakthroughs. 3- Culture:\n\nThe idea of progress itself is a relatively new\n\nBefore then, most cultures had the opposite idea of ancestor worship: that our ancestors were the greatest people who ever lived, that all the important knowledge was revealed to them, &amp; all we should do is study them. It was understandable back in the Middle Ages to look at the pyramids, or the ruins left from the ancient Romans &amp; believe they were the peak of civilization\n\nAncestor worship had to be challenged and overturned to have the scientific &amp; industrial revolutions &amp; be forward looking Compare Chinese &amp; U.S. sci-fi:\n\nIn China, they show enormous geo-engineering projects\n\nIt's an indication of the ambition to do enormous projects form the country\n\nIn the U.S. it's mostly dystopian stuff (e.g. Black Mirror)\n\nThis effects what careers people go into Stagnation?\n\nPeople say we've had a lot of progress in the world of bits, but not a lot in the world of atoms.\n\nIsn't it just naturally how progress goes? We don't make a lot of progress in every area at every time.\n\nWe used to have progress in multiple spaces at the same time. The way we get exponential growth over long periods of time is by piling S-curves on top of each other, by jumping to a new S-curve as soon as one starts to slow down.\n\nWe need clarity around how we find new S-curves, how many are going on at once, how big are they overall, etc Is science slowing down?\n\nSome fields are growing at a good pace (life sciences), others are stagnant (physics)\n\nBut overall it seems it's slowing down. \n\nhttps://t.co/1i47IPI00s GDP growth seems to be slower than it used to, why might this be?

And they sit in their comfy chair, listening to their favorite music in their bluetooth headphones streaming through spotify....\n\n200 yrs ago, you'd have been hauling water from the well to take a bath, and the water might be contaminated and you might get cholera You'd walk to work or ride a horse, and your job was probably on a farm (16 hr days all year round in all weather), and you prob didn't have access to fresh fruit year round, and if you wanted music, you'd have to perform it yourself. \"These contrasts are not vivid for people....\n\nThe way we live today is a gift handed down by our ancestors, a gift that we should be grateful for.

Remember: What people care most about is status: https://t.co/iqyFLnlfQt\n\nChristianity promised the meek that they'd go to heaven unlike rich people.\n\nBut socialism was promising the goods here on Earth.\n\nWhich is why it became so popular. It's also highly effective, b/c it attracts ppl who are loyal.\n\nSay what you want about how horrific communism is (&amp; it is!), but it breeds loyalty. USSR was loyal. China is loyal.\n\nRich people aren't loyal. They have too many good options.\n\nYou're only as loyal as your options. Socialism didn't work in the west, b/c ppl got too rich.\n\nMore specifically, ppl believed in The American Dream, that they too could get rich if they worked hard &amp; had talent.\n\nFrom a Status calculus POV, it made more sense to believe in capitalism than socialism.\n\nBut today? This is why economic growth is so important.\n\nWhen we're not growing, the world becomes zero-sum. \n\nThere's a winner for every loser, &amp; ppl focus on capturing their piece of the pie instead of collectively expanding it.\n\nLow growth presents ripe conditions for Marxism.\n\nLike now? Remember, politics is similar to economics. It's about capturing as much power as possible\n\nIn economics, you do that by giving customers what they want\n\nIn politics, you do that by giving voters what you want\n\nWhat do lower status ppl want? Higher status\n\nhttps://t.co/hGCtVeTt4a Which is why Marxism is a highly effective strategy, especially when people aren't getting rich.\n\nElections are won by majorities. \n\nWhat politicians do is say to lower status people: vote for us, and we'll give you high status. \n\nDon't vote for us, and you'll remain low status. They don't even have to deliver on their promises.\n\nThey're inherently against the establishment, they can just keep blaming the establishment for the lack of change\n\nBeing unreasonable gets you more loyal followers than being reasonable, b/c reasonable people have more options. So what's Cultural Marxism?\n\nEconomic Marxism didn't work b/c social class isn't a strong enough identifier. Once you get rich, you stop being loyal. And ppl wanna be rich\n\nAlso, capitalism provided a counter vision\n\nSo overtime, ppl saw how rich the west was getting &amp; lost faith What's a better identifier? Well, identity. What you can't change: Gender, race, etc.\n\nThose are identifiers on which people will always be loyal.\n\nAnd so there's a huge opportunity to capture votes by appealing to those axes.\n\nEven when they get wealthy, they'll always be loyal. What they did was stick to the structure: promise high status to lower status people. \n\nBut they changed the content, adapted to the new era\n\nNow people weren't poor b/c class warfare, it was because of oppression\n\nIt spread wildly. Its foil is capitalism: https://t.co/xluhnAtug6 Communism lost partly b/c there was an attractive alternative in the west.\n\nAt some point Soviet communism became lower status than American capitalism.\n\nCultural Marxism has no such alternative to point to, so it's hard to switch.\n\nIt's is the highest status system in the world. Central to this theory is the belief that humans are wired to seek status\n\nAny good political agent will organize these ppl on the basis of increasing their status, the way any commercial agent will find a way to make money.\n\nEquality is an amazing path to power for a politician: If you\u2019re below average, \u201cequality\u201d sounds like \u201cboost in status\u201d, so inherently 1/2 population is always down\n\n&amp; the only way to enact this is to increase state power, which is why it's so politically appealing\n\nEasy way to get voters, &amp; easy way to justify expanding state power Cultural Marxism is less formalized than Economic Marxism was, partially because it can't be so explicit otherwise it'd be discredited.\n\nBut also because a distributed version (e.g. press, universities) is more effective. No central choke point. \n\nHow so?https://t.co/FeQhh7IhnS This is why they are so anti-capitalist.\n\nIt gives people more options to get status, namely making money.\n\nWhen you make money, you don't care as much (e.g. China)\n\nMaking money makes people less dependent on them and thus less loyal. If it\u2019s easy to earn status through money, you\u2019ll get a house (or start angel investing)\n\nIf there\u2019s no way you\u2019re making any money, you need another path. Which path?\n\nWell you can always virtue signal\n\nThis is why they attack The American Dream: it's a threat to their power How else has it become so powerful?\n\nWithout religion, we take moral cues from our political tribes: https://t.co/PFvHp3Hgbv\n\nSay what you want about socialism, but it is a collective morality\n\nFreedom isn't a morality, or at least a collective one\n\nThis is why libertarians lose Wait: How does Social Justice lead to Economic Marxism?\n\nZooming out: What's the end state where social justice would say, \"we accomplished our goal?\"\n\nAbsolute equality of outcome.\n\n(Logically, there is no equal opportunity without equality of outcome)\n\nhttps://t.co/MxZwxFBPyy They deny it of course b/c it (communism) is politically unfeasible\n\nTo be fair, they genuinely don't believe they are advocating for it.\n\nIn practice it's: \"I would never advocate for Marxism, I just advocate for all of the policies that would create and enforce Marxism.\" Meaning: when the goal is economic \"fairness\", there's no morally acceptable line until you get to total equality of outcome\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say \"OK, we have economic fariness now\"\n\nYou don't just stop &amp; say: \"OK, the government is sufficiently powerful\"\n\nIt's always more. There's no in-between.\n\nYou're either a total egalitarian or you're not. If you are, you sign up for the whole package.\n\nIf you haven't yet, that's just temporary. \n\nThere's no stable middle ground.\n\nOtherwise your position is philosophically incoherent &amp; you will have no allies. Christopher Caldwell's book talks about how civil rights was explicitly sold on the basis of equality of opportunity for one specific group, but immediately morphed into equality of outcome for every group, &amp; created legal precedent to enact it.\n\nhttps://t.co/mobzRlEC3w Social justice aims to end all types of discrimination. \n\nInitially that was legal discrimination but over time the scope expanded.\n\nEquality (equal treatment) turned into equity (equal outcome).\n\nThat switch is how Cultural Marxism turns Economic. \n\nIt's a powerful wedge.

Whereas the same market failures (i.e negative externalities &amp; principle-agent problems) are built into most gov't actions \n\nWhich makes the cure often worse than the disease. Government protects its workers, just as trade unions protect their members, but both do it at someone else's expense.\n\nWhen unions get higher wages for their members by restricting entry into an occupation, those higher wages are at the expense of other workers. When government pays its employees higher wages, those higher wages are at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nBut when when employees get higher wages through the competition of the free market, those higher wages are at nobody's expense, and are often at other's benefit. Bigger pie.

If you think about the moral progress we made in the last 100 years, there was a time when that exact progress was deemed \"harmful\"\u2014when it was a view people would get \"canceled\" for, in the name of \u201cholding them accountable\u201d\n\nThose \"harmful\" ideas entered the marketplace &amp; won If you prevent ideas from entering the marketplace, you'll miss out on moral progress\n\nWe must assume that anything in charge of \u201cholding people accountable\u201d is likely wrong about something (otherwise there'd be no more moral progress) &amp; should be appropriately humble as a result Of course, most unpopular ideas are not breakthroughs, they're dumb.\n\nBut 1 in 100 or a million make up for all the dumb ideas. \n\nThe idea for example, that monarchy is not the proper form of government was deeply offensive at the time. So was evolution, the world is round, etc An open conversation allows millions of minds to go to work on these offensive ideas &amp; find the few gold nuggets, the needles in the haystack and throw the rest away.\n\nBut even for the dumb ideas\u2014the best way to eliminate them is to bring them to light so they can be fought.

When you curtail free speech, what happens is that you weaken the quest for knowledge and moral improvement, and knowledge and moral improvement is ultimately the solution to eliminating hate\n\nHate comes out of fear and out of ignorance. And you fight that with knowledge. There is a long history behind censoring &amp; punishing ppl for what they say &amp; it's not good: Think China, Russia, Germany at their worst moments\n\nInstead of saying that curtailing free speech doesn't cause much harm, make the case for how censorship has led to \nmore moral progress Free speech doesn't mean \"freedom of consequences\"\n\nBut we should not let their \"consequences\" also prevent moral progress\n\nIf we want moral progress, we must respond to arguments w/ counter arguments, not bullets (economic), b/c those same bullets can be used at us &amp; our speech Let's give one example of the marketplace of ideas in action: Gay rights\n\nRemember, most people in America once believed homosexuality was a mental illness, &amp; that pro-gay speech was bigoted. They wanted to prevent these ideas from entering the marketplace.\"Hold them accountable\" Jonathan Rauch believes the US has done a better job w/ gay rights than Europe because in the US we could\nidentify the hate, confront the fears underlying it, and contrasting the truth against it&amp;discredit hate in ppl minds\u2014That's what we did.\n\n\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant\u201d Consider this story to illustrate the point:\n\nIn 1957 a man named Frank Kameny is fired from his government job as an astronomer, and he's fired because he's gay. No other reason, but because he's gay.\n\nSo remember gay people in this time were treated very poorly: They were arrested in their own homes for making love to each other (&amp; got criminal records), they'd get openly beaten on the streets, and if they called the police, the police would often join in the fun, arrest the gay person instead of the person who committed the crime. Back to Frank Kameny. He never served as an astronomer again. That was expected\n\nBut what was unexpected was that he did not back down.\n\nHe believed that the Declaration of Independence was a personal promise that the founders had made to him and he decided to ensure his promise So he began an opposition movement. He appealed his firing to the US government. He failed. He appealed it to the Supreme Court. He failed. He appealed to Congress. He failed &amp; received letters saying \u201cof all the letters I've ever received, yours is the most disgusting\u201d Frank says, I went to Europe to fight tyranny overseas, only to come home and discover that I must now fight the tyranny in the US.\n\nSo he then begins representing other gay people who've been fired from their jobs because he's determined. He will win in the marketplace of ideas. In 1965 Frank and some other people led the first peaceful, openly gay protest with a protest march in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nin 1970, Frank's the first openly gay person to run for Congress. He loses, but he keeps pushing for the cause. He knows he's right. He challenges the psychiatric diagnosis of homosexuality as a disease. He does all this stuff for years, and no one ever listens\n\nUntil they do start listening! In the 70s, people begin to notice what he &amp; other gay activists are saying\n\nHis ideas start winning in the marketplace As society held its prejudice to critical scrutiny, over enough time the prejudice lost its appeal. It just didn't make sense. As soon as it did, the dominoes of hate started to fall, and within a generation people can't believe we ever had a problem w/ gay marriage. So Frank Kameny died in 2011 at age 86. \n\nHe lived long enough not only to see same sex marriage be legal in multiple states, and to see sodomy laws overturn, and to see gay people serving in US government in secure positions and to see gay people serve in the military\u2014\n\nIn 2009\u2014 He lived long enough to receive a formal apology from the US gov't from the very agency that fired him\n\nHe received their Roosevelt prize for public service\u2014their highest prize\n\nAnd best of all, the director of the agency that had fired him that was now apologizing was openly gay So this is the power of free speech and the marketplace of ideas.\n\nFrank didn't have money. He didn't have anything but the power of his ideas &amp; a marketplace to compete in. \n\nAnd that is the thing we must protect if we want to sustainably change minds and enable moral progress. /FIN\n\nFor those who want to go deeper, I recommend reading:  @jon_rauch's book \"Kindly Inquisitors\".

Harding did nothing, it went back to 3%. People talk about the kind of the government has to intervene because we had, you know, 25% unemployment during the Great Depression. \n\nAnd what they don't understand is, there was only 25% unemployment after the government intervened. Ppl in different income brackets are discussed as though they are different ppl, as opposed to to ppl at different stages of their lives\n\n56% of U.S. households will be in the top 10% at some point in their lives\n\nOf all the ppl in the top 1%, only 13% are in the top 1% for 2 yrs And the number who are in the bottom 20%, only 5% of them remain the next year. 29% of them will have gotten to the top, over 50% in the top half.\n\nAnd so you're comparing what happens to these abstract categories rather than what's happening to actual flesh and blood people? Bottom 20% of ppl are mostly: young ppl, old ppl, &amp; immigrants. The fact that young ppl &amp; new immigrants have low income is no surprise...they're just getting into the game. And the fact that old ppl have low incomes also isn't surprising...they aren\u2019t in the labor force anymore! What you\u2019d really want to see is a cohort chart where you see what happens to people who start in each bucket over time \n\nWhen people say \u201cthe incomes of most American households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades\u201d they are painting a strawman. There is no such thing as a \u201chousehold\u201d. They vary over time. They vary from one group &amp; income level to another. \n\ne.g. there are 39M ppl in the bottom 20% of households, and 64M in the top 20%. So you're saying yes, 24 million additional people do tend to have more money. Over a period of about 30 years, the household income rose by only 6%. over those same years, per capita income rose by 51%. Because the number of people per household was declining all the while. There are a lot of people who regard so called disparities and inequities and income is something that requires some great explanation seem to assume that in the absence of some intervention, everyone would have something roughly equal income. Constrained vision=Human nature is flawed, but fixed, so how do we erect institutions that contain our flaws?\n\nPpl's outcomes are often constrained by reality\n\nUnconstrained vision=Human nature is malleable\n\nThe unconstrained vision looks at pain &amp; says we must remove the pain There is no one who from sheer intellectual power can tell you what the law ought to be\n\nThe Q is, who shall have the authority to change that law &amp; with what constraints on that person so that that person is not just giving event to their own feelings or imaginings or theories?

They get wealth b/c others pay them b/c they are getting value in return. Ppl like to put down billionaires &amp; say they are exploiting the poor\n\nBut if you compare the data there are more billionaires in the U.S. than in Africa &amp; the Middle East put together &amp; yet the standard of living for the poor in the U.S. is higher than that of ppl in Africa + ME On how Socialism stinks:\n\nRussia had all the natural resources you could imagine\n\nIt was the only industrial nation which has so much petroleum that they export oil\n\nAnd the irony is one of the world's great famines occurred in the USSR. How come? mismanagement by the gov't Taxes:\n\nPeople get upset at billionaires for paying less in taxes as a % than their secretaries, but...fake news.\n\nFirst of all, the vast majority of taxes are paid by people in the upper 10% of the country\n\nIt may well be that if someone has capital gains, they'll pay lower rate Effect of tax cuts on the economy was to increase the rate of growth, increase the revenue received by the government. \n\nThe rich not only paid more taxes after the tax cuts for the rich, as they call it, they paid a higher percentage of all taxes. In the early 20s, the tax rate on the top income was 70%. The ppl making over $100,000 paid something like 30% of all taxes. \n\nBy the end of the decade, the tax rate on the top had been cut to 24% so ppl making over 100,000 now paid 65% of all taxes &amp; the reason is quite simple: That when you have a tax rate of 73% people simply don't pay it (i.e. find loopholes)\n\nSo it's the choice between a symbolic high tax rate on wealthy ppl to win votes\u2014Which the rich themselves are not gonna pay\u2014Or actual more tax revenue coming in to the gov't. Trickle down theory not a theory, it's a caricature\n\nPpl think if you cut tax rates on the rich, then there'll be less taxes for the government, or you'll have to raise the taxes on other people to make up the difference or cut programs and so forth. The above disproves that. Why are ppl poor?\n\nPpl are born poor.

It's dangerous to live in a world where people are super uncomfortable saying what they think.\n\nWe want to have debates on a lot of areas, and ask the hard Q's in science &amp; technology &amp; philosophy &amp; religion,  &amp; unearth the controversial but true ideas\n\nhttps://t.co/Ei6WhxUE5T Hyper-connectivity exacerbates the concerns ppl have around political correctness\n\nThe less privacy people have, the more pressure exists\n\nHow soon is it before we start monitoring minds for socially acceptable things to think? If the technology were there, we'd be doing it today Originality is hard. It goes against our instincts:\n\nAlready in the time of Shakespeare, the word \u2018ape\u2019 meant both primate and to imitate. \n\nThere is this imitation aspect to human nature that runs very deep. It\u2019s how we learn language as kids, it\u2019s how culture gets transmitted. But it also leads to many forms of insane behavior: peer pressure, market bubbles, cult religions, etc.\n\nIt starts by being able to tune out the people around you, being passionate about some idea or something more transcendent\u2014and, of course, being right.

The distinction some ppl draw is between individual rights and group rights.\n\nPeople were always \"protected\" as individuals, but today they're protected as groups.\n\nUnclear how to determine which groups need extra gov't protection beyond individual rights &amp; in what capacities. \"Civil Rights Act became the mechanism through which to spread an entire social agenda that the American people did not necessarily vote for, agree to, or even particularly want in the moment..\n\nserved as a precedent for kind of activist government in the in the years that follow What's big wasn't just the outcomes, it was the legal precedent set by the *process*\n\nIn short, power moved from congress to courts.\n\nBy moving to the courts, activists could get written into law things that were highly unpopular &amp; would never get legislated otherwise.\n\nShortcut. Bilingual education, for example, was implemented tops-down by the courts without any vote or pre-existing law.\n\nThis could have only happened based on legal precedent Civil Rights set.\n\nBypassing congress became an alternative way of conducting politics in the United States By the late 70s, you had something going on where you had a very expensive new constitution, but a public that was not willing to pay for it, &amp; wanted to go back to 1789 constitution.\n\nRaegan ran on this platform &amp; won. But he didnt/couldnt overturn it\n\nInstead he called a truce. Reagan ended up satisfying both constitutions by paying for it via debt.\n\nCombination of Raegan tax cuts plus social programs plus competing with Russia put us in debt. \n\nHe tried to have his cake &amp; eat it too, which worked temporarily, but future generations had to pay for it. \"So overwhelming is the hegemony of this 1964 constitution over the 1788 constitution, that our politics has pretty naturally sorted itself.\n\ninto a party of those who have been helped by the new constitutional developments and the party of those who have been harmed by it.\" In light of all this, it's interesting to think about intersectionality &amp; identity politics as not just cultural or intellectual fashions/belief systems, but also, among other things, legal strategies adaptive to their environments, thanks to 1964. The book then goes on to chronicle how Clinton accelerated it, how not much happened under Bush here, how Obama accelerated it\u2014and the book conveniently ends right before Trump is elected.\n\n/FIN. \n\nInterested in hearing responses to Caldwell's ideas "}, {"thread": "There is a widespread belief that if people of different persuasions just got off Twitter and had extended conversations, they'd resolve their differences\n\nThere is almost religious faith in the power of \"having the conversation\"\n\nClubhouse shows that this is harder than we think I say this as a big believer in the power of nonviolent communication: https://t.co/Rl99iVJ6Cx "}, {"thread": "Econ Twitter:\n\nTell me where the below is wrong or add nuance to some of the claims:\n\n- Misconceptions around monetary policy\n- Similarities btw 1929, 1990s (Japan), &amp; 2008 &amp; lessons learned\n- Was post 1929 recovery b/c of or in spite of New Deal?\n- Keynesian vs Austrian school Misconception around monetary policy:\n\nInterest rates are monetary policy.\n\nInterest rates are affected by monetary policy, but they on their own don't provide a clear measure of the stance of monetary policy.\n\ne.g People equate low rates w/ easy money &amp; high rates w/ tight money But in fact, easy monetary policies tend to result in high inflation\n\n&amp; that actually leads to very high interest rates\n\nOther misconceptions flow from that misguided belief that  interest rates are monetary policy\u2014\n\ne.g. That monetary policy is ineffective at zero interest rates Mistake: \"Reasoning from a price change\":\n\nDrawing conclusions from price or rates w/o thinking abt underlying reasons\n\nPrices can be high for two reasons, demand can go up or supply can go down\n\nAnd if prices are high, because supply went down, then yes, consumers will buy less.
