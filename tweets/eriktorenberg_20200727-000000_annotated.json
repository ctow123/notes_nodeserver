You now needed:\n\n- More agile product strategy\n- Different GTM strategy (old model was expensive sales channel partners. In new model, deals are smaller &amp; higher velocity)\n- Marketing &amp; product can't be silo'edWhat metrics should CS managers prioritize?\n\nLagging indicators - Gross Retention Rate &amp; Net Renewal Rate (includes upsell) &amp; NPS\n\nLeading indicators - Depends on product but could be overall adoption, daily active usage, NPS, e-mail engagement,Much of this was inspired by @nrmehta, CEO of @GainsightHQ and author of \"Customer Success\"\n\nhttps://t.co/0eKXgcOT0j\n\nI went deeper w/ him here: https://t.co/BQ0vM9BFxz",

However, unless you\u2019re the NYT, trying to do everything is a recipe for failing at everything\n\nThese strategies require diff approachesOn one side you will have the aggregators as ideal vehicles for content creators who value reach; on the other new kinds of tools that enable direct connection\u2014&amp; funding\u2014from fans. Maybe this whole Internet thing will turn out pretty good after all\u2026unless you\u2019re a publisher.Video is safer b/c it's very expensive to produce (or buy rights to), so hard to substitute \n\nVideo has been increasingly differentiating itself on either quality (HBO) or exclusivity (ESPN)\n\nThe value of tech cos in each space is inversely proportional to value of the publishersThe rule of thumb around marketplace businesses is that you either have a low take rate and high margins or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge w/ Neither/New companies (e.g WeWork) end up with relatively low take rates combined w/ relatively mediocre margins.\n\nhttps://t.co/hANITRohrX",

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways &amp; quotes from Keith Rabois interviews \ud83d\udc47:I think most ppl who succeed at changing the world have extreme talent in at least 1-2 dimensions. They also might have a screw loose in at least 1-2 dimensions.\n\nThe ones that thrive are self-aware enough to know where their screws are loose, &amp; seek a compliment to solve for it.If you\u2019re going to succeed as a startup, you need to be able to find and hire undiscovered talent. \n\nYou cannot recruit people who are proven.\n\nWhy? There will always be large incumbents outbidding you when trying to hire known talented individuals\n\nhttps://t.co/yuyx5Sogd3Quoting Vinod Khosla: \u201cThe team you build is the company you build\u201d\n\nQuoting Patrick Collison: \u201cThe reason why the first 10 employees are the most important is every one of those 10 employees is going to replicate him or herself 10 times.Before Hiring, figure out what type of role you\u2019re hiring for:\n\nIs it a value creation roll? (AKA creating value from scratch)\n\nOr are you trying to preserve value? (AKA you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up)\n\nFormer is harder to hire for.When attempting to hire unrecognized potential, you'll inherently make mistakes (if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re too conservative)\n\nDon\u2019t try to be a \u201czero-defect hirer.\u201d\n\nThe false-negative hires (the ppl you didn\u2019t hire that could have been great) are more of a mistake than the bad hiresWhen you need upside, hire aptitude. When protecting against the downside, hire experience.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to create something from scratch, experience is often a handicap\u201dDouble down on your stars:\n\nIf you believe you have ppl who have 10x value creation, improving their abilities is way more important than trying to fix ppl who will never create 10x value. \n\nManagement drag is created when too much time is spent helping struggling employees.What to do w/ struggling employees?\n\nMost managers in baseball usually make the mistake of leaving in their starting pitcher too long, as opposed to calling for the relief pitcher\n\nThe starter got you so far, but you need a different skill set to go forward.How to identify stars? \n\nNotice who people in the company go to talk to that they don\u2019t have to (watch whose desk becomes popular \u2013 this is especially noticeable in an open office).\n\nThat's how you discover the problem solvers\u201cConstantly expand the scope of responsibility for every single employee. Everybody will break at some point, but you want to keep pushing the envelope until they can\u2019t discharge that level of responsibly successfully anymore.\u201dBenefits of small teams:\n\n- People have an ownership mentality\n- You can see who\u2019s doing well\n- It\u2019s easier to spot the existing skill gaps\n- People have a sense of independence\n- A narrower focus/scope results, this improving executionUp until 20-50 employees, manage \"through osmosis.\"\n\nAfter that, weekly-wide company meeting, weekly 1on1s w/ 5-7 direct reports (direct report set agenda)\n\nEveryone should understand the company\u2019s priorities, business equation, biggest risks and plans to solve for them.In a startup, domain expertise isn\u2019t all that important\n\nExperts tend to know what you can\u2019t do very well. They don\u2019t ask enough why questions; \u2018Why can\u2019t this be done this way? I like people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re tackling, but they\u2019re fast learners.For investments: \n\n\"I tend to like things that are super ambitious, that are almost ridiculous. Just how ridiculous? \n\nI want half of my VC friends to laugh at an investment I make. If half don\u2019t laugh, it means I\u2019m not taking enough risk, and the project isn\u2019t ambitious enough.\"Criteria for founders: Magnet for Talent.\n\nHow to test?\n\nCall former colleagues of the founder, and ask them if they would join (or invest in) the founder\u2019s current company, and why/why notOn Total Available Market (TAM) Analyses:\n\nThe real issue with a small TAM is not that the market isn't big enough, it's that the value prop isn't compelling enough. If you make it more compelling, you'll capture more value.Startups have roughly the same amount of pain to go from 0 to 1, regardless of whether 1 is a $100 billion company or $100 million company, so you might as well do something important because the pain\u2019s going to be the same. You might as well get the outcome that offsets the painHow to be strategic? Understand the business equation.\n\n\"Every business, when it works, is like an equation \u2013 X times Y times Z with some weighting. Understanding that equation in your brain, and being able to manipulate the variables, is the key to being strategic.\u201dPeople w/ good strategy know what knobs they have at their disposal, which they can turn and how they affect each other. If you know one knob can only be turned up to 7, they don\u2019t try to turn it to 8, they say \u201cmaybe we can turn this other knob up and it\u2019s more likely to work\u201d.Margins don\u2019t matter as much as you think, but cash flow does:\n\nImagine you have a business that kicks off at 10% margins, but it grows to be 10% of everything on the planet \u2013 that\u2019s a big business\u201cIf your tech is better, but potential customers are too set in their ways to switch, use it yourself and compete with them\u201d \n\n\"If you\u2019re a company who\u2019s better at reducing fraud, you don\u2019t want to sell that as service to somebody else, you want to build the full stack yourselfBeing a component in someone else\u2019s stack doesn\u2019t usually end well\n\nThere\u2019s the adoption risk issue (long sales cycles etc.)\n\nThere\u2019s economic issues \u2013 you\u2019re only capturing 10-30% of the value you create, if you\u2019re selling to someone else, depending on how good you are at sales)As an example, if you have a differentiated advantage (say in chip design or battery life) you want to ship the end product to the customer yourself (and not sell your batteries to someone like Apple) \u2013 this way you get more credit for what you\u2019re asymmetrically good at.Lesson learned from Pat Riley's Winner Within:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the best at what you do, you want to be the only one who does what you do\u201d\n\nYou often have to narrow the scope of what you do to accomplish that.Keith\u2019s Superpowers:\n\n1/ Being able to spot 19-28-year-old people with talent, who have yet to be discovered or experience success, and project their future potential (and then go on to mentor or invest in them)\n\n2/ Blending design thinking w/ empirical analysis.On deciding btwn founding v. join:\n\nFind path w/ steepest slope. Something that makes you nervous/uncomfortable. If not, you\u2019re not maximizing growth\n\nSome learn best thrown into the deep end, try to swim (founding). Others learn best by watching first (joining)\n\nKnow your style.Once someone gets older, there\u2019s enough data points on their resume where many people could evaluate their background and come to the same conclusion; their potential and abilities are well-defined.What you want to do is find someone that doesn\u2019t have enough data points, and instead you have to try to project potential and how they may translate to a certain profession without knowing with certainty.For example, a CS student from Stanford is incredibly overrated in terms of demand for their talent versus what they can actually do on average. You have plenty of people throwing money at them. They don\u2019t always develop the best work ethic because of that. They're entitled.What you want to find are people that other people aren\u2019t chasing after but they have even more talent &amp; grit. That\u2019s doable, but hard. It\u2019s a little bit like drafting athletes in various sports. You're trying to find Tom Brady in the 6th round.What to look for in a co-founder? \n\n#1 Someone who can help you solve core risks to the biz. Identify core DNA &amp; backfill accordingly.\n\n#2 Someone who agrees w/ you on 1st principles (data vs design driven culture, closed vs open ecosystem, similar instincts on ppl).Is VC more like baseball or basketball:\n\nBasketball: Team cohesion crucial, 1 Lebron can dominate, but can't have 3 bc not enough ball to go around\n\nBaseball: Mostly collection of individuals &amp; clear accountability, can have many heavy hitters, 1 Lebron isn't as dominantDecision making framework:\n\nDon\u2019t make a list of pros and cons; that\u2019s not a great way to make these kind of decisions.\n\nFigure out your number one priority, and optimize on that dimension.Ben Franklin had this great quote which I\u2019ve always used as a guide for my own decision-making and career. It\u2019s, \u201cTwo ways to be successful in life: do something worth writing about or write something worth reading.\u201dFavorite interview question:\n\nWhat do you want to do with your life? That\u2019s usually my first question. Sometimes it catches people off-guard, but it allows you to quickly understand who they are, what they care about, and calibrate your feedback.If you\u2019re going to attract people with extremely high potential, the first thing you have to do is let them thrive. \n\nYou have to give them the degrees of freedom to do both what they can do very well, and to some extent, allow them to make mistakes.If you try to constrain really talented people, you\u2019re only going to create a mirror of yourself with your same strengths and weaknesses. \n\nYou HAVE to let people do stuff that you disagree with. You can\u2019t tell how good they are if they\u2019re just replicating what you\u2019d have them doManage People on Inputs, Not Outputs\n\nOtherwise nobody on your team will take on the more difficult tasks.\n\nSo, to incentivize employees to complete ambitious tasks, gauge the quality of their work based on how it effective it was at getting you towards an ambitious goal.On why anti-lean startup:\n\nThe best metaphor for creating a startup is like producing a movie\n\nSomeone has a vision for a movie, writes a script, casts it, finances the production, markets the film with a trailer, and then distributes it (and hopefully people come to see it)Thiel used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. \n\nAnd we all rebelled, b/c it's so unnatural, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing.Calendar audit: when I work with CEOs, I ask them to specify their priorities they are, pie-chart style, and then pull out their calendar and see if it matches.\n\nIt never does. Recruiting is the big thing that doesn't align.\u201cThe whole fake news debate is ridiculous. The average American today is by any metric, more informed than the average American any time in history.\u201d\n\nTyler Cowen has said \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say about Facebook that isn\u2019t true of the printing press\u201dDefinition of Professional Success:\n\nThe number of undiscovered talented ppl he\u2019s able to mentor that turn out to make meaningful impact in the world.\n\nThe number of companies he\u2019s able to help or influence, in one way or another, that end up going on to transform the world.",

Went so far with communism they ended up on the nationalist right.In 2011, tech stopped becoming beloved to the left (&amp; started threatening their existence) for the following reasons.\n\n- Economically attacking traditional American left power centers (NYT, Hollywood, Academia)\n\n- Undercutting prestige &amp; influence (e.g. fake news)- Pulling away top talent to tech companies\n\n- Becoming a more powerful global culture exporter\n\n- Building a network of super-wealthy people w/ an alternative network and path to power (Instead of become president, become CEO).\n\n- The outcome of 2016 election.One thing they implicitly mean by \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d is that tech is disruptive to how they work:\n\nHarvard does a study, NYT reports it, US gov\u2019t enacts it\n\nWhat do they want? Power. Protect their existing institutions (NYT, Harvard, Big Gov't)\n\nSoftware ate too much for them",

    "full_text": "Some of my favorite takeaways &amp; quotes from Mike Maples' interviews \ud83d\udc47\n\n\u201cThe thing that I like to assume is every startup idea\u2019s been tried\u2026 So, the question is not, Has my idea been tried before? The question is, Is it the right time for my idea to happen?\"A startup isn\u2019t a company until it hacks its way through 3 distinct miracles:\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n1) The insight hack (insight development)\n\n2) The value hack (customer development)\n\n3) Growth hacking (going from 0-1 to 1-X)Value hacking:\n\nFigure out what you can uniquely do that ppl are desperate for\n\nIdentify a focus group of customers that desperately need your solution\n\nIterate &amp; improve your value proposition relentlessly until you start to see signs of exponential organic growthIf your value prop as a startup isn\u2019t true enough, &amp; your customer isn\u2019t desperate enough, you won\u2019t grow exponentially. You\u2019ll instead have to spend $ to overcome the objections to the gaps in your value prop.\n\nOnly think about growth after you\u2019ve proven your value hypothesis.On ideas:\n\nMost people are looking around their present world and searching for \"white space\" -- \"startup opportunity\". \n\nInstead, live in the future, find what's missing, and then show people the way forward.It might be time to start your startup when:\n\nYou have insider knowledge about a major change event.\n\nYou know the market opportunity and customer needs in a visceral way.\n\nYou have a vision of a problem to be solved based on your knowledge of the first two pointsHow do you know when it\u2019s time to double down on an idea?\n\nWhen no one can talk you out of doing it\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone reasonable who can talk you out of it, you\u2019re probably not ready for it\n\nOr when the pain of regret from not trying &gt; any possible pain experienced from failing\"Sometimes the world puts an opportunity in front of you that you\u2019re in a unique position to capitalize on before others, that leverages a unique domain skill you have, and takes advantage of something you\u2019ve seen before others because of your vantage point. It\u2019s tempting to say:\"You\u2019ll tackle it when you\u2019re ready\u2014when you have your things in place, when you have your ducks in a row, when the economy is more stable \u2026 But the reality is, if you plan to start something great, these kinds of opportunities are extremely rare\u2014maybe even once in a lifetime.\"The startup law of the jungle:\n\nStartups are initially very vulnerable to predators (like a newborn animal on the plains)\u00a0\n\nBeing non-consensus and right affords the startup the time to survive, adapt, and &amp; \u2013 no one preys on them because no one believes their idea\u2019s importantWith your product, have a good answer to the question:\u00a0\u201cWhat job do our customers hire this product to do?\u201d\n\nWhen you buy a new product, you hire it to help you do a job\n\nIf the product does the job well, you\u2019ll tend to hire it again\n\nIf it does a bad job, you\u2019ll fire itWhen you\u2019re starting a startup, you\u2019re going to war together. You gotta know you want to be in the fox hole with this person. You GOTTA know it. Because it\u2019s impossible enough as it is. A lot of these startups fail because the founders can\u2019t see eye to eye on what has to happenLaunching Paradox:\n\n\"If you aren\u2019t embarrassed by your product, then you launched too late\u201d - Reid Hoffman\n\nBut Steve Jobs &amp; Apple are the opposite: perfectionism. \n\nThe former approach works better when you\u2019re the only person showing up with something they\u2019re desperate forWhy Nows\n\nTechnology inflections: When Mike invested in\u00a0Lyft, GPS locators in cell phones had just gotten good enough for ride-sharing\n\nAdoption inflections: Also contributing to Lyft was the fact that nearly everyone had smartphones.Navigate the Idea Maze: \n\nAssume every idea's been tried, and ask why now or why you would have a different outcome.\n\nQ's to ask:\n\nWhy did it fail?\nWhat were the assumptions? \nWhy are my assumptions different?\nHow is the world different in a way that may change the outcome?On capital intensiveness: \n\nI like ideas where you can light a forest fire with just a match. I think that on some level, the true measure of the disruptive power of an idea is the degree to which it can make change without throwing money at it.Fundamentally, a startup is all about harnessing exponential change to create a unique value proposition ppl are desperate for, that changes their point of view, &amp; grows at hyper-warp speed, all done by ppl who live in the future. This has been remarkably true for remarkably long",
